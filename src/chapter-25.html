    <h1>#25. Learn to Do What They Do <small>If you walk a mile in their shoes, you’re more likely to remove the stone</small></h1>

    <p>If I had a chance to take a poll of all the programmers in the software companies, I bet I’d find out that their number one gripe is that managers have no idea what they do. The runner up would probably be a substitution of “manager” with “Project Manager.” After that, various other gripes about those involved in the project not understanding the complexities or technologies involved.</p>

    <p>If you’re a manager who has previously been a programmer, I’ve got a tip for you. Don’t forget to do what you used to do. Take some time out of your day, week or month to make sure you keep the set of skills you have current. This will benefit you in two ways. If you ever get downsized, you can still jump back into the programmer role. <span>(Or become a freelancer.)</span> Either way, you’ll be able to earn a wage. My experience has shown that a manager is a hard position to find and fill <span>(maybe because it seems that they are rarely let go?)</span> The second benefit of staying current with your skill is that your team will notice that you still care. You’re a manager, sure, so your work responsibilities are different. But, you’re not forgetting where you came from.</p>

    <p>It’s even more important to take extra steps if you’ve never been a programmer. You may never be able to program like those on your team, and that’s perfectly fine. That’s probably even a good thing. It helps you have a different perspective. But, in order to do your work properly, you need to have two things: an understanding of the assigned tasks and the respect of those who you lead.</p>

    <p>Understanding new projects and the tasks required to complete them is easy. Really, it is. Just take some time and sit with your programmers and ask them what they’re doing. Tell them you’re not there to try to slow them down <span>(if you can work extra time into their schedule for the inevitable delay you cause, even better!)</span>. You’re not there to judge them or watch over their shoulder in a negative way. You just want to get a deeper understanding of what their day requires.</p>

    <p>I think about the show “Undercover Boss” and how valuable those days undercover can be for the leaders and CEOs. They get to learn firsthand what it’s like to do the job. But, here’s where it’s different. The undercover boss <span>(or yourself in our example)</span> has the authority and ability to correct some of the wrongs that the employee may not be able to themselves. If you have to do an annoying task yourself, you’re much more likely to want to fix that process for the staff. If you never had to do it yourself, it’s pretty easy to just ignore the complaining or assume it isn’t as bad as it’s described.</p>

    <p>Another way to stay in tune with your staff is to take a class. You can go to a free or cheap online class. You may even want to enroll in a technical school or online college for a short amount of time. Get educated about what your team is doing on a daily basis. This will not only help you understand the tasks better, but it will also garner respect from your team. They know you want to keep up with them, not just bellow at them to do it better, cheaper, and faster.</p>

    <p>Speaking of respect, that’s a bonus added to your toolbox if you learn to do what your employees do. They may want to mock you <span>(to your face or otherwise)</span> for being so poor at the skill, but deep down they will respect you for taking the time to learn about their tasks. That’s the best way to be a leader is to show that you’re willing to do whatever they do. Never assign someone a task that you’re not willing to at least try to do. If you fail, that’s fine. The goal isn’t to be a great, well oiled successful programmer. That’s why you have your team. Your job is different so this failure is ok. Remember, though, one key responsibility of your job is to understand your team’s job.</p>

    <p>Everything your team does is important. If you have designers, learn about the design process. Take some classes on design theory and color choices. Learn to do a basic “hello world” program in each of the languages your team uses. Learn to compile and deploy the software. Join your tech support and technical writers as they attempt to explain the features. Write a chapter of the manual yourself. Submit it to the team to “peer-review.” Learn what it’s like to do what “they” do and you will do your own job better. You will be on your road to becoming the best manager you can be.</p>
