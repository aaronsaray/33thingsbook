    <h1>#15. Test Everything <small>9 out of 7 users agree, bugs suck</small></h1>

    <p>One very cold, very icy night, I was driving a bit too fast. Ok, I was driving my VW Rabbit way too fast. Suddenly, a dog jumped out in front of me. Since I’m a dog lover, I hit my brakes as hard as possible. I slid out of control and hit two fences and bounced off of a F&#8211;250 truck. Side and front airbags deployed and I survived with just minor bumps and bruises. One of the reasons why I got a VW was because I trusted their safety record. Even in an accident, this car performed as expected. More on this later&#8230;</p>

    <p>As a software developer, it is very important to test everything. Test your code, test all the scenarios that could happen, and test it in every environment that it can possibly be used. Just because something “should” be fine doesn’t mean it will. Test it. Test it again. Finally, when it’s done, have someone else test it.</p>

    <p>I’ve never met a programmer who didn’t have bugs in their software. I’ve also never met one that didn’t acknowledge the fact that they could have tested better to have less bugs. It’s common sense, yet we seem to forget about it. Test, test, test! <span>(Or, my favorite excuse that I hear now that I’m a manager: “I didn’t have enough time.” Um, a buggy finished program is the same as a non-finished program to me. Sorry buddy!)</span></p>

    <p>Testing is incredibly important. <span>(Don’t believe me yet? I suggest looking into Test Driven Development. This whole discipline and methodology is built around the importance of testing first.)</span> It’s horrible that we forget it or put it on the back burner because the standard non-programming person doesn’t understand bugs. Why in the world would the piece of software not work as defined? They’re not programmers, so they don’t understand the complexities required of programmers and creating something from nothing. They just don’t understand that bugs are bound to happen. So, the less bugs, the better. Even one bug is bad when it comes to the users. </p>

    <p>Remember my crashed VW? Can you imagine if there was a bug and the airbags didn’t deploy? Well, I mean, the car always stayed on the road and it never randomly accelerated <span>(here’s looking at you, Toyota)<span>. But when I had an accident and it crashed, a non-standard event, the airbags didn’t deploy because of a programming bug. The programmers could defend that I shouldn’t crash my car, so the bug is moot. However, luckily, VW tests their cars. They test, test, test. I trust their car and their process.</p>

    <p>In software, trust is important. Bugs erode trust. This trust is broken easily when something doesn’t go as planned. And, remember, because normal users don’t understand programming, they can’t comprehend the difference between different priorities of bugs. That’s why its important to not have any <span>(or more realistically, very, very few)</span>. That only comes through testing.</p>

    <p>Buggy products destroy perception even in the non-technology world. “Bug” perception is not restricted to software, only. Imagine the first time you visited a restaurant what you would feel if you were served cold potatoes and a burnt steak. <span>(That is, unless you asked for a well-done steak. And then, friend, you don’t understand meat. Matter of fact, give me your steak, I’ve got a nice piece of beef jerky I can trade you.)</span> You’d not only be very unhappy with your current experience, but you’d probably not trust the restaurant to have a replacement meal ready for you. Even if you got a better value and a higher quality replacement meal, it just wouldn’t taste the same. You’ve lost trust in that restaurant to meet your needs. </p>

    <p>If you asked the kitchen staff, they might tell you what happened. They hired a new cook and he wasn’t familiar with the stove and warming equipment. Because no one tested his prowess combined with the new environment, he made a ‘buggy’ dinner. Now, they might have lost you as a customer permanently. As a programmer, you need to test to make sure there are no bugs in your product as not to lose your customers.</p>

    <p>After a particularly long project, one developer I was working with seemed a little stressed. He was working on the last feature for this release and was ready to push it out to production the next day. I had to sign off on it before we celebrated the finish of this product and release cycle. When I was running through the feature, I noticed that he had inadvertently messed up another feature. I told him about it and he said he just found that too. He said it’s not that big of a deal, hardly anyone uses that feature, and he’d fix it on the next 2 week cycle release. I said that wasn’t good enough, we couldn’t do that. We couldn’t knowingly introduce a new bug in an existing feature just to get our new software out the door. He didn’t seem to understand why that was a problem.</p>

    <p>I reframed the situation by using the example of online banking. Imagine that you were transferring funds using an online banking system provided by your bank. You meant to transfer $400 from checking to savings. Instead, there was a bug in the software and you transferred $4000. This created an overdraft. When you notified the bank, they admitted there was a bug, they fixed it, and refunded the overdraft fee. Now, I asked the programmer, how likely would you be to use the software again? He said probably not that likely. I asked why not? They admitted there was a bug, they fixed it, and they even took care of the fee that they had imposed by accident. He still wasn’t convinced: “I just wouldn’t trust it - I mean it’s an online banking website, they shouldn’t have bugs.” </p>

    <p>As he said that, I saw his face change. He suddenly realized what I had been saying. Any bug erodes trust. Even if you take care of it, you still cause distrust in your customers. The last sentence I said in our conversation before he went back to work to fix the issue was a mantra that I repeat a lot in the teams I work in. “Release the quality you’d expect.”</p>

    <p>It’s important to test everything. Remember, any bug affects the customers in a very negative way. We need the trust in our software to continue to serve our customers properly.</p>
