    <h1>#28. Programmers Are Like Rockstars <small>Luckily, with less instances of leather pants, though</small></h1>

    <p>Creating product, building revenue and profit, and reducing waste are all things that are highly prized and studied in the manufacturing world. We’ve been producing things for such a long time that we now know how to get the best performance out of each one of our tasks. We know there are different types of assembly lines that operate, different performance metrics that can be used to measure output, and all kinds of ways to get more of the same product out in less time.</p>

    <p>Manufacturing is not easy. But, in general, we know how to do it now. General managers of production plants can sit down and develop spreadsheets and scenarios to measure output and productivity. If your shop makes 100 widgets today, and 105 tomorrow, you’ve created a measurable gain. It’s pretty much a linear style of creation which comes with a linear style of management.</p>

    <p>Now, think about some famous artists. They create paintings or sculptures with amazing style and tremendous beauty. When they’re done, they’re done. No one really knows when the next piece of art will be available. That’s fine. When the artist finally releases a piece, you can be sure that it captures the essence of their message and embodies their soul. This is now displayed proudly or perhaps put up for sale. It can be days, weeks, months, years - who knows - before we can find a way to measure the return on this piece of art.</p>

    <p>And somehow, this is ok. In fact, this whole idea is welcome <span>(well, tell that to the starving artist)</span>. Artists can be eccentric, they don’t need a schedule, and they don’t need a predictable turn around time. There’s no real management here. No one is measuring them.</p>

    <p>Now, let’s jump between the two extremes to talk about rockstars. A musician goes and creates a brilliant piece of art. They put everything they have into the words. They toil along until every note is perfect. Then, they release the art and it’s done. It’s available to be appreciated.</p>

    <p>But what does a rockstar do next? They go on tour. They have to take this beautiful piece of art they created and duplicate it flawlessly many times. They’re attached to it, they love it, so it’s not that hard the first few times. As time goes on, though, to them it becomes drab and old. They may be so bored with playing it that they talk bad about the song even.</p>

    <p>But don’t you dare tell them it’s bad. You can’t agree with them. Want to see someone prickle up real fast? Agree with that musician that his song sucks. Who are you!? You can’t write a song this good. This is a part of me. Don’t say that!</p>

    <p>But even though the song is old and boring, they get up again and play the song. You know when you go to the concert, they’re going to play the song you know. They’ll <span>(try)</span> not forget any words and aim to play it perfectly. You can measure the success of this rockstar by how many seats they sell each night. If you raise the prices, and people still buy the tickets, and the rockstar is more successful. As the artist gets better and more famous, you definitely can raise the prices because fans will pay.</p>

    <p>When it comes to programming, I’ve seen examples using both of the extremes. You have the outsource shop that puts a ton of programmers in a room. They measure the contracts they get, the lines of code they deploy, and the number of projects completed. It doesn’t matter if the solution is good or elegant. It only matters if the solution solves the problem. And, if you can get more solutions finished faster, that’s more measurable product and more success. The manufacturing business of programming is really easy to understand because we have a handle on the manufacturing business of goods.</p>

    <p>Then, far too often I see the artist mentality perpetrated into programming. As almost a knee-jerk reaction from the manufacturing view of programming, managers jump to the extreme opposite side. Or, at least they’re being convinced by the programmer. <span>(Drat! You’ve been caught!)</span> The programmer knows what he does is an art. It’s done when it’s done. I don’t need to do any estimates. I can’t tell you if it’s going to work right. I need to refactor and make this better. The solution must be the most elegant and beautiful solution ever. The diva artist mentality of programming is live and well!</p>

    <p>But a great programmer is somewhere in between these two extremes, like a rockstar. <span>(Oh no - that doesn’t mean I like all the job ads that say “rockstar programmer needed” - if I never hear that term again, I would be one of the happiest people in the universe.)</span> There is an art that is programming. It’s not just as simple as making a widget in the same way over and over. Some of the problems sound like the same thing, but the solution is always affected by many other dependencies. But, the point is, the solutions are art. This can’t be measured as simply as one might expect.</p>

    <p>But, in the same way, the programmer can get to a point where they can produce the same product <span>(or close to it)</span> in a consistent manner. It just takes work. It takes practice, but it can be done. It’s a combination of artistry in a set of code or a library used repeatedly in new projects.</p>

    <p>When managing programmers, it’s important to think of the rockstar mentality. No, I don’t mean give them extreme riders, but give them everything they ask for, within reason. Let the art flow. You will notice how protective and proud they get of the art they create. And, then, it shifts into the concert stage. Once that art is created, let them duplicate it over and over. Just don’t forget, the next album is set to release next year. <span>(Or in programmer terms, after some time, you’ll need to refactor.)</span> When you realize how to keep programmers out of the manufacturing management plan, but keep them scheduled on something that can be duplicated, then you’ll really have those rock star programmers.</p>
