    <h1>#29. Sometimes, Just Ask Why <small>All mommies and daddies are probably cringing now, though</small></h1>

    <p>What happened to “why?” What happened to make people so afraid of asking this question? Perhaps it’s when all of the kids start asking “why” about everything. Why does daddy have to go to work? Why do we need money? Why do we need to buy food? </p>

    <p>Or perhaps it’s been the poorly trained hoard of bosses and superiors who have asked the question “why” which somehow was almost drowned out by their arrogant incompetence. When the purposely ignorant ask “why” it can be quite annoying.</p>

    <p>It might even be the menacing “why” asked by the scary vice president at your company. You know, the question is phrased as an innocent request for information but which is dripping with malice and anger. “When you hear ‘why’ from the VP, you best run!”</p>

    <p>But, “why” doesn’t have to be so bad. I think the greatest inventors asked “why.” So many “why” questions have lead to so many awesome discoveries. There is a very good side to this question.</p>

    <p>I think “why” should be asked more often. But it requires the right framing. When used correctly, “why” can be one of the most important questions you can ask programmers on your team.</p>

    <p>Before I get into further detail about how “why?” can help, I need to make something incredibly clear. When you ask a programmer “why,” you are not being disrespectful. You are trying to learn. So, don’t act like they did something wrong. This destroys the confidence in your desire to learn and can turn programmers defensive. Once you can completely grasp the fact that this is not meant to be a ‘check-up’ on the programmer, you can start to communicate this to them as well. When you ask “why?” you’re not meaning to say that you disrespect the decision that the programmer made.</p>

    <p>I’ve heard managers say that if they knew how to do all the programming, then why would they need the programmers. When you ask “why,” we’re not talking about knowing every detail about the actual code. As a manager, you should have an intimate knowledge of the decisions that are made and the solutions that are applied. You may not have a complete understanding of the technology or its implementation, but you need to understand why it was implemented. That returns us to the core question and point here. You are asking “why” because it is your job to understand why. You don’t necessarily need to know how.</p>

    <p>You are simply trying to get a better, broad understanding. This will help you make better decisions as well. You are learning from the programmer, not questioning their skill or integrity.</p>

    <p>When you ask the programmer “why,” you get two benefits: the chance to make the programmer <span>(and quite possibly yourself)</span> think through the task thoroughly and the ability to provide feedback.</p>

    <p>When you ask someone “why,” a unique thing happens in the brain. Instead of having this vague reason floating around in the brain, it has to be solidified and put into spoken word. This is something in itself. There are times when we make decisions without thinking about it. I bet in the last few seconds, you adjusted your arm, perhaps supported your head. You made the decision to move your arm to do this. Why? Was your head too tired? What if that cost you five cents every time you made a move with your arm. Would you think through each movement then? </p>

    <p>The point is, when you ask the question, you get the person to put the time into describing and owning the decision. As a consequence to your question, the programmer must now own all decisions they’ve made and actions they’ve done. There is no simple “just because” anymore. <span>(“Just because” causes business to lose tons and tons of money a year. Don’t believe me? Take a whole day and write down all the tasks you do. Then, ask yourself why. For fun, count the number of times you answer “I just always do it that way” or “just because.”)</span></p>

    <p>In addition to getting to hear the programmer’s rationale behind their decisions, you get to rehash the project in your mind as well. You might hear some crazy reasons from the programmer for what they’re doing. But, perhaps that’s because what you asked for is a little bit “crazy.” Or a more accurate example, if the programmer is giving you some really wild reasons, perhaps this can demonstrate that the benefit of the project compared to the work involved doesn’t add up.</p>

    <p>Asking “why” is an organic opening for feedback. Sometimes it can be hard to find the time to remind your staff that they’re doing a good job. And, let’s face it, sometimes it’s easier to ignore a problem if you can just shut your office door and not have to work with them directly. This “why” time allows you to give them both positive and negative feedback. </p>

    <p>Try it. Just a few times. You’ll see what I mean.</p>

    <p>When you hear something that seems like it was a great idea, say so! Other times, when listening to a complex explanation, take the time to mentor and tutor the programmer along. Perhaps their solution is complex and doesn’t necessarily take into account the day-to-day business concerns. Take this time to teach them a bit more about the business, the part that you dwell in, so they can make better decisions in the long run. Of course, if they’re mistaken, this is the perfect time to point it out and help develop and discover the correct solution.</p>

    <p>But there’s one more important thing you must do when asking the question of “why.”</p>

    <p>Don’t interrupt. Ever. Resist the urge. Don’t do it. Wait. Just wait. You’ll have your turn.</p>

    <p>When you first start out asking the “why” questions, it might already be stressful. But remember, nothing turns up the heat and ignites a defense more than interrupting the conversation. Let the programmer finish. Even if you know, or think you know how the story is going to end, wait, and let it end. Allow them to finish their thought. Make sure you can determine the difference between someone taking a pause for a breath, waiting for their thoughts to form, or just being nervous. Listen, listen, listen. <span>(I’m sure there are whole chapters or books in the management arena about the importance of listening. Do it!)</span></p>

    <p>Don’t interrupt during the answers to your “why” questions. This just causes stress, makes things tense, and kind of demonstrates your lack of respect for the programmer. Remember, by asking “why,” the investment the programmer is putting into an answer is actually really doing you a favor. They know the solution and are responsible for the end product. By the strictest sense, you don’t need to know the reasons for everything. But it sure helps you become a better boss and manage projects more effectively. Don’t interrupt.</p>

    <p>When executed properly, “why” can be one of your most valuable questions. Show your programmers you care about their thoughts and decision process by asking about it. Take the time to give feedback and show respect. Ask “why” with a smile - and mean it. Something as simple as that will make you more informed and make you a better manager.</p>
