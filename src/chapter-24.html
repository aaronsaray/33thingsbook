    <p>In a world where instant message, text messages, and email rule, the written letter languishes as a decrepit communication tool. Who writes letters anyway? <span>(I’ve had the same 40-pack of forever stamps since&#8230; well, since forever stamps were first released. I have 3 left. I think that should last me at least two more years.)</span> But, you’d be surprised at the response you get when you send a written letter. I’m not talking about the letter that Grandma sends on your birthday with the world’s crispest $10 bill. I’m talking about a real, live letter, from one colleague to another. </p>

    <p>When you get this letter, you barely know what to do. Is this junk mail? It looks like it has come from someone you know, so probably not. You slowly open the envelope with&#8230; your fingers <span>(who needs envelope openers anymore?)</span> You get a papercut and proceed to bleed all over the enclosed letter <span>(well maybe I have worse luck opening letters than you do)</span>. You read it, hold it in your hand, and somehow seem to smile. Someone wrote you a letter.</p>

    <p>The simple act of writing a letter made a difference. It was unique. And if the sender asked you to do something for them, it was effective. Somehow, you just did it. You bowed to their demands. They did, after all, send you a letter. Through the mail. It had a stamp. They paid to send this to you.</p>

    <p>These feelings you get from a letter are studied in detail by direct marketing mailing response firms. They know everything there is about this tool and they use it effectively. These companies know there is a difference between sending an email to a mass list versus directly mailing you a letter. <span>(What’s the difference? Why does this work? That’s the topic for a whole other book.)</span></p>

    <p>But, there is something important to notice here. Even with all the other ways to communicate now, a letter triggers a response in a unique way. It has a certain effect. We’ve been using letters since we settled our country. <span>(Actually much, much longer.)</span> This was the only way to communicate. It kept relationships strong, is the stuff of love movies, and was the final note on business negotiations for decades. Letters reigned supreme for way longer than any of the readers of this book were alive.</p>

    <p>Recently, we moved into the world of electronic communication. The wave of the future! Let’s replace the tried and true letter with a low cost, super high available communication method. It works, and it works well. However, I would be one of those that would argue that just because something works better, you shouldn’t completely abandon the older ‘technology.’ I mean, we have classic car shows and antique shops. The letter is an antique. And, as my story has demonstrated, even more valuable at times.</p>

    <p>The letter draws parallels to other real time communication. In modern business, you now have so many choices for real time communication. You can text, you can instant message, you can call on the phone <span>(who does that anymore?)</span>, or you can join a chat room. <span>(Want to know how to really prank me? Join my team as a programmer and master the intricacies of smoke signals for real time communication.)</span> </p>

    <p>And then you have the last technique anyone seems to want to do these days: face to face. Face to face is almost today’s postal letter it seems. Why would I get up and walk over to the office of another person if I could just send them an email? </p>

    <p>Something special happens when we communicate face to face, though. We develop a relationship and communicate non-verbally. This actually helps us to be even more efficient.</p>

    <p>How!? How can it be more efficient to walk over and talk to someone than to send them an email? Let’s look at relationship and non-verbal communication.</p>

    <p>When you build a solid relationship with someone, they are more intune to your communication style. Because of that, you have to explain less. They just ‘get you.’ Granted, you can develop relationships through text alone; many dating websites have proven this. But, we still meet people in person to take it to the next level. Face to face has something to offer: the efficiencies and rewards of a relationship.</p>

    <p>The second is the non-verbal communication. True, if you’re programming and speaking simply in code, you might not fully see how the the statement that 94% of our communication is done non-verbally applies to you. I get it. But, as a manager, chances are you’re speaking less in code, so you don’t get to use this excuse. And, since you are a manager, you like numbers now. <span>(I know you have at least one spreadsheet in your inbox.)</span> Let’s break this down into efficiency numbers.</p>

    <p>You have something you must communicate. It is an important thing that the team must do. You have to communicate the urgency and importance of this particular message. By the numbers, only 6% of the message is communicated verbally. That means to get 100% of the message across, without face to face interaction, you must invest nearly 17 times more into the conversation using text. If you could speak face to face, the numbers say that you could get this done 17 times faster, or more efficiently.</p>

    <p>Of course, that was kind of a fun and silly exercise. But, let me put it into an example that might make it easier to understand. You have something important and urgent that you must communicate to your team. If you sent an electronic message, you could communicate this topic. However, it can be difficult to tell how urgent the need is and how totally passionate you are about this thing you’re communicating. This means that you’ll have to decorate the message with more description indicating the importance. </p>

    <p>The message becomes longer. Those with short attention spans stop reading and just scan your message. All this effort you made to make the point stronger is actually lost and the message is diluted. Now, imagine doing this face to face. Normally you might walk into your team’s area and communicate information out loud and informally when it’s not too important. Today, you ask everyone to turn around and stop working. You take a seat in the middle of the group, sit up straight and slightly lean forward. You communicate with a calm yet stern tone what you need the team to know. There is no doubt that this message is different and the team should listen. You really care, it’s important and it’s urgent.</p>

    <p>Face to face communication is the key. And as a manager, you need to understand this. Programmers might be more willing to IM, email or even text and shy away from face to face communication. You’ll need to force them. But that’s ok. In the end, it’s worth it.</p>

    <p>The way I’ve implemented this in my own team is by having a face to face meeting with each of my employees at the beginning of the week. This time face to face helps me build a relationship. Because I meet with each person individually, sometimes I have to repeat myself. But, I invest in this repetition because I know that my message has hit home more thoroughly through the relationship I’ve built. I’ve more efficiently said my piece face to face compared to generating some super long email talking about each project for this week that the programmers may likely ignore till lunch <span>(or later!)</span>. </p>

    <p>Another thing I do goes hand in hand with the ‘open door policy’ you hear many managers boasting about. They may keep the door open, but when you walk in, you feel like you’re interrupting them. Well, you are. But, that’s their job. If you continue to compose an email, making the team member wait, you’re being a jerk. I bet this person doesn’t really come into your office that much anymore because of this. Remember, as a manager, your primary job is the management of your team. The rest is less important. Stop being a jerk with an open door.</p>

    <p>When programmers walk into my office, I do two things. First, I immediately stop what I’m doing. I greet them and turn all of my attention to them. And second, I physically turn my body towards them. I want them to know that we’re face to face. I want to show that I’m valuing what they have to say. This allows them to ask their question or communicate their concern in the most efficient manner. You know what it’s like to go to your own boss with a concern? It can be hard. It can be intimidating. By removing barriers, stopping what you’re doing, and giving them the 100% communication offered by a fully committed face-to-face conversation, you’re reducing the amount of communication required to get their points across. They will appreciate this for both the reason of having to communicate less and the respect that you’re showing them by making them the center of your world for this short time.</p>

    <p>Face to face communication can be hard when you’re working with people working remotely. I understand that, but in this age, there’s really no excuse. Webcams are either built into laptops or for sale under $30. Free services like Google Hangout or Skype exist. Take advantage of these. While you’re not physically face to face, you can see them and they can see you. <span>(Plus, if you’re working with remote people, this might encourage them to put pants on just this one time during the week!)</span> </p>

    <p>There’s no excuse not to have meetings with remote workers ‘face to face’ over video conference. It might seem weird at first, but before you know it, it becomes second nature. One word of warning, though. If it is at all feasible or possible, do not rely on video conference if you can physically meet in person. Only use video when you absolutely need to. </p>

    <p>I think face to face communication is one of the basic human needs. And dear manager, your programmers, deep down are human. Give them the gift of being able to speak to you face to face while you enjoy the efficiencies and benefits of it. To be the best manager you can possibly be, just show your face. </p>
