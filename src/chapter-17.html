    <h1>#17. Disagree In the Form of a Question <small>I’ll take useless subroutines for 400, Alex</small></h1>

    <p>Earlier in my career, I decided to study body language. I learned about some of the cultures of various states, countries, nationalities, how to detect someone who may be weaving a tale of deceit, and how your body gives away the fact that you’re attracted to the opposite sex. <span>(It’s interesting, certain people are known to perspire when they have a little bit of sexual attraction. In the United States, we are taught to be embarrassed of this. Please wear tons of antiperspirant! No one wants a sweaty dude or chick. However, studies have shown that one of the main ways to release attraction hormones is through the sweat. Believe it or not, you might actually be attracted to a person more if they have a certain amount of sweat.)</span></p>

    <p>During my study, I saw one particular demonstration that really drove home how important body language is. <span>(I still somehow find that crossing my arms is incredibly comfortable even though it looks like I’m annoyed during meetings. Perhaps this sign of “I don’t care” would be less comfortable if I lost the shelf of a belly towards my front? Anyone want to weigh in? OOH Nice pun!)</span> This demonstration was based around personal space. </p>

    <p>The first thing that was done was a test of face-to-face personal space during a conversation. Two subjects face each other and have a conversation. While the conversation progressed, the antagonist moved forward inch by inch. When he was finally too close for comfort, the other person would say “STOP” and the distance was measured. In the example I saw, about 16 inches was as close as the one person wanted to be to the other.</p>

    <p>The next demonstration was the same basic conversation with the same actors. Instead, they both leaned against a wall instead of facing each other. As the conversation went on, again the first person inched closer to the other. The final “STOP” was issued at a distance of less than 3 inches from shoulder to shoulder. </p>

    <p>That amazing demonstration was meant to show how body positioning and posture have a great effect on the way someone is open for conversation. Those same lessons can be translated into the world of communication in software programming.</p>

    <p>If you’re like me, you’ve had at least one <span>(just one??)</span> example where you’re being told to do a task or program something in a manner that seems insanely ridiculous. However, it may be the stakeholder, boss, or client’s request. They’re proud of the solution they came up with and you must do it exactly to their specifications. </p>

    <p>And you know what this pride also brings? Defensiveness. Yup, tell them you disagree with the solution they’ve proposed, and you’re dead in the water. No matter if you were trying your best to get the greatest return for the investment, you are now the enemy. Why won’t the damn programmer just do what I tell him to do?</p>

    <p>You may want to tell them they’re wrong. It’s easy to insist that you’re right. After all, you know best. This is what you do. All they do is sell coffee tables, but you’ve created over 300 inventory tracking systems. You are absolutely right, they are wrong. You’re going to continue telling them that until they believe it! </p>

    <p>Don’t you think that might be a bit confrontational? Like having a conversation face to face? Try aligning with them instead. Could you try forming your critiques in the form of a question? Do you think it would hurt? I think all you want is for them to be successful, right?</p>

    <p>Two paragraphs ago, I meant to ignite your passion. If you’ve been programming for even a little while, your blood boiled when I painted the picture of the demanding, hapless client. After reading the last paragraph, however, doesn’t it all make sense? Didn’t the idea I proposed just feel right? Could you disagree with any question I posed? </p>

    <p>Yes, you already trust me - you’re reading this book, so you’re going to try to believe what I tell you. But, even if you weren’t already sold, my goal was to sell you on my point of asking questions. Did it work? If you disagreed with anything I said, didn’t you feel like that would be so crazy and wrong?</p>

    <p>When you’re faced with a particularly tough truth or fact, try phrasing it in the form of a question. Instead of, “I don’t think the next button should be at the top right,” try, “do you think there would be any harm in positioning the button at the bottom right?” For the mastery students, “do you think that customers might misinterpret that button at the top right as the cancel or close button? What if we tried putting it at the bottom right? That would still keep the flow consistent, right?”</p>

    <p>This type of communication is also tested in the world of marketing and sales. When you get a potential client in the form of responding to YES-based questions, the last sales based question seems like a no-brainer. Do you lose productivity during the day? Do you value productivity software? Do you like saving both time and money? Would you like to purchase this software today - at a 20% discount? Yes and YES! Give it to me!</p>

    <p>A corollary to this approach is the multiple choice question. If you find that the decision maker has… well&#8230; made decisions poorly, try something new. Instead of giving your own answer in the form of a question, just blow them away with a thoroughly researched response containing multiple choices. This is a tactic that should be used sparingly, though. You don’t want to get your project too off the path. Just throw it in here and there, especially when the real right answer might be too extreme for them to buy into yet. Give them incremental choices in the form of a question with multiple choices for answers.</p>

    <p>When you know the right solution is not the one you’re being asked to program, try the dispute in the form of a question. Note how positioning yourself as the choice-giver instead of the negative denier can help you achieve what you need while adding even more value to the project.</p>
