    <h1>#4. Real Talent is Making Things Simple <small>No, please. Talk to me like I’m a first-grader</small></h1>

    <p>I remember when I used to have to time the start of a television movie just right so I could fit the entire broadcast onto a VHS tape. I knew that for longer movies, I’d have to either lower the quality of the tape recording or make sure to pause the recording during commercials. I had to make sure I bought the right VHS tape, connect the coaxial antenna cable to the VCR correctly, and be vigilant about making sure that the tape didn’t become jammed. </p>

    <p>Apparently, I was lucky. I was told that watching movies and recording them used to be much harder than this. Fast forward today and recording a television show is as simple as finding it in your listing <span>(present or future)</span>, and clicking record on your DVR. It has plenty of space to record the broadcast, even in HD. You don’t even need to be awake or around. This is pretty simple.</p>

    <p>If you look closely, the trend in all technology is directly related to making things simpler. The interfaces become simpler <span>(it’s not that difficult to use an iPad - 2 year olds are doing it)</span> and parts of our lives become simple or automated. Marketing is poised around the concept of simplicity. Rarely do you hear something like, “On your Android mobile phone, you can easily install any software package by searching for it in Google Play Store. Or, you can find the proper .apk and upload it. You can also connect using adb and push packages to your phone over usb. You have so many choices!” Instead, marketing says, “the iPhone syncs all your apps from the app store - you never have to worry about choosing or installing anything new again.” Everyone seems to value simplicity.</p>

    <p>Let’s move beyond the concept of programming and software. Success is measured by simplicity. When someone is selling a wonder-cure or a get rich quick scheme, it’s all about how simple it is. <span>(No one wants to buy a product that requires 120 steps to get payback. Give me 3 steps or less, or it’s not worth it - not even for a million dollars.)</span>. Speaking of rich, have you ever noticed how refined and simple the truly rich person’s belongings or clothes are? Compare the $10 speckled, multi-colored button up shirt from Walmart <span>(a budget-conscious choice)</span>, to the flashy designer t-shirt <span>(someone looking to demonstrate the illusion of wealth and success)</span>, to the simple cotton woven dress shirt with quality stitching and no logos <span>(look at how real millionaires dress)</span>. The plain pin-stripe suit that gushes luxury by simply having equally aligned vertical striping. Simple, elegant, successful.</p>

    <p>Real talent is making things simpler. Great programmers create simple solutions. Let’s break this down into code and user interface.</p>

    <p>The best code is the simplest. Very elegant solutions often come in simple, small packages. When creating code for your project, continually concentrate and focus on making sure that the code is simple. If you start extending and mangling the code in such a way that only someone with a deep history of the project can work on it, it’s no longer simple. It’s no good. If this is the path you’re following, it’s immediately time to refactor. Even when you’re creating it the first time, keep an eye on the simplicity of your code. How can you do this in an easier manner? </p>

    <p>Within the concept of simple code comes another warning: don’t try to be too clever. Actually, don’t be clever at all. Whenever I hear about a programmer coming up with a really clever solution, it&#8217;s usually way too complex. A great programmer is excited about the solution, the technology implemented, and the solution they came up with. However, they should also be proud about how simple the solution is with the right code, not how clever the solution is by twisting and turning that square peg of code into that round hole.</p>

    <p>Along the lines of being too clever, short and simple code should not be created just for the sake of creating simple code. Have care not to sacrifice the readability, art, and flow of your code while trying to make it simple. I’ve seen this interpreted wrong a few times: “Oh, to make it simple, I named this instantiated class ‘x’.” Looking back, no one knows what ‘x’ means. Yes, it is simple, but it doesn’t mean it’s good.</p>

    <p>The simplest and most elegant code won’t guarantee success of the project if the users can’t seem to use it. The second area to concentrate on simplicity involves the user interface. </p>

    <p>There are a lot of competing thoughts on what makes a great user interface. Some experts argue that the best user interface is one that anyone could use intuitively. Others suggest that in some situations, the interface must be customized to the workflow. Custom workflow interfaces may not be the most user-friendly, but they do guarantee speed within a custom job. I’m not going to pick a solution or solve this problem for you. This book is too short for that. I tend to lean towards the intuitive use spectrum, so that’s how I’ll frame the rest of my explanation.</p>

    <p>A good rule to follow regarding simplicity in user interface is to test it with some non-stakeholders of the project. Remember, you’re so close to the project that you won’t be able to address the interface as good as someone fresh, new, and not as invested. With this, of course, comes the requirement that you must be open to the suggestions from the fresh pair of eyes. Test the interface with many people and see what resonates. Did this really work? Could something be simpler? Do they have to ask you questions to use it or can they figure it out right away? Are there any unneeded requirements to be overly precise when using the interface? <span>(“Oh no! Please don’t wiggle the mouse! You’ll destroy everything!” I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that means something’s wrong with your design.)</span></p>

    <p>Creating simple user interface is important. <span>(For those programmers who have designers and UI/UX people to work on this with them, consider yourself lucky!)</span> The best suggestion I can have is to listen to the project requirements and then determine the need of any specified interface suggestions. Try to determine if the suggestion is mandatory or if its just the stakeholder’s vision for solving the problem based on their limited experience. You’ll be surprised: sometimes even your outside view can greatly simplify the interface that the project needs. When you aren’t solely focused on the daily business, you can have that fresh view. Be ready to make the case to support your decisions, however.</p>

    <p>A really great, talented programmer makes things simple. He or she can create artistic, simplistic, elegant code solutions with intuitive and simple user interfaces. Whenever possible, recognize that the simpler you can make something, the more it will be accepted and the better it will perform.</p>
