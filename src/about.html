    <h2>What's This All About?</h2>
    <p><strong>tldr;</strong> It's free advice - because I want you to do better than I have done.</p>
    <h3>What's the Story Here?</h3>
    <p>After writing my first book on PHP Design Patterns, I was fine.  Life goal accomplished.  And then it happened - a Google Alert that mentioned my name and had a link to an author website.</p>
    <p>This is embarrassing... </p>
    <p>This is the truth.</p>
    <p>The alert said "Aaron Saray, One-Time Author."</p>
    <p>I felt like it was a punch to the stomach.  Maybe it was ego.  It was definitely ego.  But, I thought it sounded like I had tried and failed.  "He was only able to write ONE book - pfft!"  So, I decided I wanted to write another one.</p>
    <h3>Why This Topic?</h3>
    <p>My agent had a lot of opportunities for me.  Introduction to programming books, technical editing, essays about project management.  But none of them really felt like I would be doing something DIFFERENT than anyone else.  Anyone can teach you how to program.  I always thought I had a different take on the world.  And, I've heard a lot of times that I frame things in a very understandable way - "for a programmer."</p>
    <p>So, I decided to do some self-reflection about my career.  I made a presentation called 7 Things I Wish Somebody Would Have Told Me and started touring local and regional conferences.  The information was well received - and even used as a keynote.  I knew I had something.  So, I wrote 33 Things.</p>
    <h3>So, Why Is This Free?</h3>
    <p>My agent didn't think that she could sell the book - but she tried anyway.  It didn't work.</p>
    <p>I looked for a new agent.  No one would take me.  I heard a lot of excuses (too busy, etc), and started talking directly with the publishers.  I finally ran across one that gave me some good, solid feedback.</p>
    <p>We don't know how to market this book.  And, you're not famous, and this reads too much like a memoir.</p>
    <p>I'll give them that - I do use a lot of stories in my writing.  So, I can see where you might think that.  But, to think that only famous people have things worth teaching really perturbed me.</p>
    <p>Finally, I went and talked with a friend who worked for a small publisher.  They offered to publish the book with a favorable royalty split.</p>
    <p>But that never happened. 13 months later I exercised my right to terminate the publisher rights contract.</p>
    <p>See, I had written it, edited it, and actually peer-reviewed and copy-edited it with some professionals I know. It was ready to go.  But 13 months later, I kept hearing the same story "Next month..."</p>
    <h3>You Didn't Answer the Question!</h3>
    <p>I could have self-published the book I suppose.  I could make some money that way.  But, it occurred to me that people who I think would most benefit from this type of work - my advice - may not be able to afford to purchase the book.</p>
    <p>So, in the spirit of my Open Source roots, here is a free, open-sourced book.  I've spent literally YEARS on this.  I'm proud - but my motivation is still simple and pure:</p>
    <p><a href="/introduction">Please read</a> the <em>33 Things I Wish Somebody Would Have Told Me</em> - and learn, grow, and become a great programmer!</p>
