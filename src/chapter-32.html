    <h1>#32. How to Deal With the Idiots Upstairs <small>The bigger the dinosaur, the smaller the brain?</small></h1>

    <p>I struggled with where to put this topic. I didn’t know if it made more sense to include in the manager section or the programmer section. In the end, I decided it belonged here. A manager’s reaction to a challenge situation can have a deep, rippling effect on the team. I think it’s more important to address your reaction as a manager, but this concept really applies for any position on the team.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, a completely insane requirement comes across your desk. It may be for a new programming project or a fresh HR initiative. I’ve had many of these questionable requests. <span>(Oops, I just switched back into manager speak. I meant insane requests.)</span> You stare at it and just get incredibly confused. What is the point of this? Or even worse, I think this is going to hurt the company!</p>

    <p>The first thing to do is to make your case. Don’t sit back and let things flow downhill. Remember, you were there once. Don’t make the same mistake that some employees do. As a manager, remember the company is a conglomeration of all of the work and decisions each employee of the company does. If you think it doesn’t affect you, you’re wrong. You are just as responsible for any decision as anyone else in the company. You should always be trying your best to make sure the company succeeds. Sometimes, that means taking a stand against silly or dangerous projects. </p>

    <p>Put together your thoughts and make your case. If you can sleep on it, do that. Try to remove the emotion. Assemble a counterpoint and proposal that includes the following parts:</p>

    <p>First, demonstrate that you understand the requirement. Explain that you understand each point. If you can’t do this, you shouldn’t be disagreeing anyway! You could be missing something that makes your total argument a waste of time or invalid.</p>

    <p>Second, suggest or predict what the negative ramifications could be of this project. Depending on your communication style, don’t forget to prioritize these in order of impact. Mixing minimal impact and epicly dangerous, high impact topics with one another causes each topic to blend together. Instead, start with the worst case or the best case <span>(glass half full vs half empty?)</span> and work your way to the other side of the spectrum. Remember to keep your predictions based on actual experience and fact, not on your feelings. Speaking of feelings, repeatedly take time to review your work so far to make sure you’re not communicating with any emotional statements. </p>

    <p>Finally, give suggestions. You must come up with some alternatives otherwise you’re just one of the many complainers that fill up cubicles each day. You know the type. Don’t be like the annoying ones that come to you complaining about a situation but don’t have a solution or suggestion to alleviate the problem. You’re just supposed to know. Do yourself the favor of not passing this inconsiderate method of communication upward.</p>

    <p>Once you have a chance to communicate your case, you have two outcomes. Either the submitter will apply your changes and move the project forward, or you’ll lose. If you’re lucky enough to get a new proposal implementing all of your changes, great! Move forward and get it done. But, do not brag about it. Don’t tell your team about the horrible proposal that was submitted. Resist the urge to tell them about how you saved their asses. Instead, bring the proposal forward like any other. This is a project that we’ve been given, let’s do it. The difference here to recognize is while you’re a team player, fighting for your staff, you are not peers. You shouldn’t share with them these wins. The people who need to know <span>(your boss)</span>, already know. If you really need to share this, find a friend. Don’t share with your employees like this. All this does is make you sound like a blowhard and diminish the respect and authority of those above you. That’s not your job.</p>

    <p>The other outcome is that you might lose. You might lose hard. That’s ok. Just eat it. Don’t complain. Don’t go and grumble to your team about how bad the proposal is or how you fought all these points. The more you complain to others, the less professional you look. </p>

    <p>Your job is to be a representative of the company and its decision makers. Take this seriously. If you complain downward, you’re only bringing yourself to a lower level, removing any shred of respect. </p>

    <p>If you really must answer questions from your team about the project, be polite in the way you handle it. I’m not suggesting you lie, just frame the response in a way that may not add your personal support to the proposal, but backs it with your position. “This isn’t necessarily the way I’d personally do this, however, I think we can make this work.” “The decision has been made to do this set of tasks. I think if we put our best foot forward, we’ll still be successful. If it turns out bad, we can use this as an experience to help teach others why they might want to do it a different way.” It’s all about framing it the proper way.</p>

    <p>One last little note about complaining and sharing. One of the best tips I’ve ever heard was one sentence: “Share downward, complain upward.” The point of this is simple. When you have information <span>(that you can share)</span>, share it with those on your team. Give them more information, it empowers them. It allows them to make decisions. However, when you have complaints, complain upward. Find your boss, shut the door, and make your case. Do not go to your peers or to your team and complain. While it may make you feel better in the very short term, that’s not the path to being a successful manager.</p>
