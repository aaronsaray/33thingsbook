    <h1>#10. Don’t Underestimate Analogies <small>A good analogy is like a nice, chilled bottle of bourbon&#8230;</small></h1>

    <p>There is this weird, crippling fear that non-computer users have. I’m not sure how it started out or where it comes from. All I know is that it’s real. And, believe me, you’ve seen it. That frustrating feeling you have when explaining something technical to a person while they seem to slink away. That’s it.</p>

    <p>It’s that deer in the headlights shut down that happens, that unattached gaze, or the immediate denial of being able to do what you ask. It’s quite an irrational response to the thought of having to use a computer or understand how it works. I hate it.</p>

    <p>But, I learned how to get past it. The key is an analogy.</p>

    <p>Analogies are used all the time when we’re trying to explain things to each other. If you think back to your classroom days, I’m sure the teachers and professors used these to help explain concepts to you. Analogies offer a way of relating something that you already know about to something that you don’t. And, as you have probably now guessed is a common theme in this book, I’m saying that programmers have forgotten something we once knew before we became programmers. A great way to learn is through analogies. It’s also a great way to reduce fear.</p>

    <p>One of the best examples I can think of involves ditching support for Internet Explorer 6. This is a real email that I sent the project stakeholder.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>If we take a look at the market share of IE6 on your website, it’s small but still measurable. I can’t say no one comes to your site with IE6, but I can say it’s under 5%. Now, I recognize that 5% of visitors is still a large number. We don’t want them to be unhappy - and so that’s probably the reason you’re asking for IE6 support. Unfortunately, I can’t provide that compatibility without considerable additional cost. IE6 contains a flawed model of displaying pages, so it requires much more work than the standards based website I made for you. Let me explain it a different way.</p>

        <p>I’m 99% certain that your car runs on unleaded fuel. Most cars do. However, there is a very small subset of older cars that may run on leaded fuel. Perhaps they are hobby cars, or they’ve been grandfathered in after our emissions and safety laws. Either way, a very small portion of drivers need leaded fuel. </p>

        <p>If you look at gas stations, you’ll find various versions of unleaded fuel as well as diesel. You won’t find any leaded fuel, though. Why not? There is clearly is a market for it, right?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the market for leaded fuel is very small. However, the amount of investment required to store and distribute leaded fuel is at least as much, if not more, than unleaded gasoline. This means that the gas station owner would have to sacrifice some of the space and inventory to satisfy a very small market segment. The gas station potentially could even lose money when customers find out that he doesn’t have enough of the fast-moving, highly sought after unleaded fuel. So, he elects to not distribute leaded fuel. He may know a few people who are very passionate about their needs of leaded fuel, but he needs to make the fiscally sound decision.</p>

        <p>In this instance, IE6 is like the leaded fuel I’ve mentioned. There is a very small subset of people who need IE6 support, but you will have to make a choice on how to provide this support. Either your costs increase dramatically <span>(I don’t believe the ROI on this investment is worth it - and yes I know I’m talking myself out of money as your programmer!)</span> or you’ll have to lower your features and requirements for the other 98% of your users <span>(which may make it harder to create conversions into paying members)</span>. </p>

        <p>In the end, the choice is yours - I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the type of decision this was. I didn’t want to get you bogged down in the technical details, that’s our job, not yours! </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>As you can see, it may have gotten a bit wordy and long. However, the core message here is that I was able to explain the Internet Explorer 6 support requirements using an analogy that the stakeholder understood. In the end, we didn’t have to supply Internet Explorer 6 “enhancements” - whew!</p>

    <p>There’s no way to shield “regular people” completely from the technical aspects of some of the work you may be doing for them. However, making sure you communicate in a way that is simple enough goes a long way. I like to also relate this idea to a doctors visit. My best friend is a new doctor. When she starts rambling about her most recent medical knowledge, I feel like I don’t know anything at all in life. I know she’s really smart, but I just kind of tune out. </p>

    <p>When I actually need medical attention, my own doctor is experienced enough to give me the information in a way I can relate to. Only after I understand the basic information does he go into the details I want to know. This is like the doctor saying, “You have too high of blood pressure, you eat too much salt.” That’s pretty easy to understand. An alternative could be where the doctor described the condition as a dangerously high systolic pressure, usually from eating more than twice the recommended sodium content. While that still is a relatively simple explanation, wasn’t the first one easier to understand? </p>

    <p>Don’t estimate the power of analogies when communicating technical information to non-technical people. After all, most of us were taught in part by other analogies during our youth. So why do we suddenly forget to use them when we are working within our own realm? </p>
