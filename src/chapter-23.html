    <h1>#23. Do Something Different <small>Are you surprised? You said you were up for anything, right?</small></h1>

    <p>When I was very young, my best friend had a dad that was just larger than life to me. Well, first of all, he was over 6 foot and seemed to be a giant man. But, he also was into computers and played guitar. I looked up to him for all three of these reasons!</p>

    <p>At one of my first “computer jobs” I remember talking to a coworker about his band. He wanted to release his own CD. I decided to create a website for his music. </p>

    <p>When I do public speaking about the topics in 33 Things, I usually like to ask “who plays a musical instrument?” Without fail, more than two thirds of the audience raises their hands proudly. <span>(After the first three times, I remember thinking that I must have stumbled upon something here&#8230;)</span></p>

    <p>Looking back, I realized that every single technology job I worked at had a larger ratio of musicians than the rest of the population. I personally have been playing guitar since I was 14. I even created, wrote, and produced my own solo album. </p>

    <p>Perhaps to be a great technical programmer, you have to play guitar!</p>

    <p>Or saxophone?</p>

    <p>Or piano? Some instrument?</p>

    <p>No, that’s wrong. However, to be great, you need to remember to do something different. Do something besides program. I know this can be difficult, especially when you’re passionate about your project and your work. I remember many years working full time and then coming home and continuing on the project work until the wee hours of the morning. I seemed to have amazing output, but I was working sometimes up to 20 hours a day.</p>

    <p>Then I hit a roadblock. When I compared my output to my peers, I was blowing them away. However, they seemed happier, and were involved in multiple activities, sports, and even family time. I was doing none of that. I then compared myself to some geniuses in my particular technology field and realized my output was nothing compared to them. Wow! How can this be? I only spent 4 to 5 hours a day non-programming!</p>

    <p>That’s when I realized that I could become a better and more efficient programmer by doing something different. That doesn’t mean that I was quitting programming, no sir! It meant that I was going to spend my time programming, but also dedicate some time to other tasks. Maybe all these musicians knew something I didn’t. <span>(Sudden confession time: though I had been playing guitar since I was 14, the more serious I took my programming career, the less I played. I found that I’d play less than once every few months before my realization.)</span></p>

    <p>I started practicing guitar every night after work. I found myself working about 12 hours on programming, 2 hours of playing music, and the rest relaxing and sleeping. My output was even slightly higher! I continued down this path until I came up with a mix that is perfect for me. Now, I spend more time with friends and family, create amazing programming projects, plunk away on my guitar here and there, and still educate myself in business and management.</p>

    <p>Now, I’m not saying you can never program when you get home from your programming job. If you must for short periods to keep on a deadline, fine. But, evaluate your deadline afterward and make sure you don’t get stuck doing that again. If you really are passionate about programming, make sure to do a completely different discipline after your main work. For example, when I was at a job a few years ago, I would architect very modular and enterprise level PHP and MySQL. I worked with message queues, object oriented domain designed classes and services, and tweaked as much performance out of my database as possible. Sometimes, when I really wanted to do a little nerdery when I got home, I would experiment with the development releases of Chrome and Firefox to test out their support for the new HTML5 spec. I technically was still programming, but I was doing a completely different discipline. I was engaging a different part of my brain.</p>

    <p>The goal of doing something different is to engage all parts of your brain. The Right Brain is used for artistic things <span>(music, painting, designing)</span> whereas the Left Brain is used for more logical tasks <span>(programming, performance measurement, arranging a sound structure)</span>. As you do something different, you engage both parts of your brain. While I’m not a certified “brain-expert doctor guy,” I can tell you for certain there is a benefit to doing this. At the very least you will have the same output for a shorter amount of time. Chances are, though, that you’ll be more imaginative and creative. You may even start to see the art in your code!</p>

    <p>Do something different. Pick up a musical instrument. Acoustic guitars can be purchased very inexpensively at rummage sales, craigslist or even your local music shop. <span>(My first one was a $5 P.O.S. brand that would untune itself after an hour.)</span> You might even mention your desire to learn to other programmers you know - I’m sure at least one of them has an extra guitar they could lend you to check it out. You can take lessons, try to figure it out yourself, or watch countless YouTube videos to learn your new instrument. This is just another challenge like a new programming language! Oh, and bonus! You already type, so you have significantly more control of your fingers than other beginners will have. </p>

    <p>Do something different. Start creating some sketches or art. Almost all of us drew interesting little pictures when we were younger. <span>(You probably know when I say interesting I mean not museum-worthy, but who cares!?)</span> When did that desire go away? When was it suddenly not ok to create art for the sake of making art? Next time you want to mock up a new interface for a project, complete the task as you normally would. Later, take home this idea and try to make it even more detailed with pencil and paper. Or, you can explore other creativity by installing things like Photoshop and edit some stock photography. There are many Photoshop tutorials online that teach basic photo editing to advanced creation of art from scratch. Are you more extreme? Your local department store probably has some inexpensive canvas and artistry paints near the crafts or kids section. You don’t have to be a kid to use these. Grab a new set and start painting. See what happens.</p>

    <p>Do something different. Read a book. You remember those, right? I don’t mean read some interesting blog entries about being frugal or traveling the country. I mean, grab a fiction book or a biography and commit to reading it. <span>(I found that while I like the idea of Kindle or iPad reading, I still get real books. Something about being purely disconnected while enjoying the book still speaks to me.)</span> </p>

    <p>A mentor of mine once told me that I should start reading famous biographies. I protested saying that I really didn’t like history. I remember him laughing and saying “You, and every other 20 year old.” He went on to say that he figured out a long time ago why young people never seemed to like history. It wasn’t history itself, it was their lack of understanding of the point of studying history. They just finished school, so they were purely trained and intent on knowing the facts. And, he said, history facts, dates, and names can be boring. He said the study of history was something different. “History isn’t so much the what, it’s the why.” That has stuck with me for years! That last sentence made all the difference to me. I started reading historical works, not to know what year George Washington became General or when Susan B Anthony was drawn to the temperance movement, but to understand why they chose these paths for their lives. </p>

    <p>There are three books that I’ve read in the last few years that have greatly shaped my personal and professional life. I made the commitment to do something different, and I’ve been rewarded. </p>

    <p>“Losing My Virginity” by Richard Branson made a great impact on me. I’ll try not to give away all of the secrets of this books or ruin his stories, but I can say a few things. Branson had both success and failure in his career. He tells the story of his various wins and losses, and the decisions he made. Now, I would consider him pretty successful. What I learned from this book: “Don’t be afraid to take a gamble.” I relate this to the programming world in a few ways. First, while staying in the bounds of what the client or stakeholder needs, you can still take some risks and gambles. Don’t be afraid to make small decisions on their behalf. Of course, don’t get crazy, but don’t be afraid to gamble either. The second way I relate it to programming has to do with new technology. Most of the people that are super successful in our industry took the gamble. They saw a new trend or technology and went at it full-force. These are the people we all look up to, they gambled and won. It may be easy to sit back and go where you’re needed, but if you want your own record label, mobile phone service, and airline, take a gamble!</p>

    <p>The next book that I really enjoyed was “Decision Points” by George W. Bush. I don’t think many would argue with one simple fact: during his presidency, there was a lot going on. Depending on your political beliefs, he either became one of the most respected or most criticized presidents in recent U.S. history. I remember being very interested in following the news stories during his presidency. I was interested in seeing how the war was going, how the economy was doing, and his response to the United States’ largest terrorist attack. In his book, Bush described a little bit more about each of the main decisions in his presidency. He explained information that the general public might not have gathered from the media reports. He admitted to his mistakes, but also defined the reasons for his other, less popular decisions. Regardless of your opinion of his decisions or him personally, the book is a great read. The biggest thing I took away from this was some clarification in some of the decisions he made that I didn’t agree with. While I may or may not have changed my opinion of those decisions after reading the book, he did explain and point out a lot of other things that I didn’t know about. I learned that there is always more to a decision than meets the eye. I feel like this is also a very good point for programmers to grasp. I’ve heard the phrase so many times: “oh that’ll be easy” or “I can get that done really quick.” Inevitably, the project is late or that “real quick” turns into 5 to 10 times longer than expected. There is always more to every decision than meets the eye! Take the time to analyze all parts before making the decision.</p>

    <p>The last book I’ll mention is “Confessions of a Wall Street Analyst” by Dan Reingold. This book gives an insider look at the analysis that was done for large companies like WorldCom. Reingold explained some of the tricks that companies were using to inflate their value. He also pointed out places where analysts, including himself, missed the boat. The main thing I learned from this book was simple: You don’t always know what you thought you did. Programmers will get in trouble if they assume too much. I can think of a few times where I gave quotes and commitments based on a very large assumption. I never disclosed that I was assuming so much and therefore I failed to meet expectations. Programmers should make every effort to make sure they are aware of all aspects of the task or project.</p>

    <p>Are you looking to take your skills to the next level? Do you want to create even more output and possibly work less? Then, do something different!</p>
