    <h1>#18. Guarantee Long-Term Quality Using Two Development Paths <small>Or fall over and break your neck, whichever is better</small></h1>

    <p>Having lived in Wisconsin my entire life, I have a great appreciation for our natural resources and attractions. We have a great lake ecosystem, lovely rivers, and distinct seasons <span>(if you’ve lived here or been here for a little while, you understand the sarcasm of my appreciation of distinct seasons I bet)</span>. One thing that we don’t have, however, are the serene and lovely beaches of the coastal states. <span>(We have some beaches, but come on. They’re not the same. Plus, no starfish.)</span> I’ve heard great stories about going to the beaches, enjoying the cabanas, and swimming out into the ocean to cool off. Those things are just not the standard fare in Wisconsin.</p>

    <p>I think one of the most interesting things about the beaches are the sand castles. I have always been interested in how they were made and how builders became inspired. I used to play in the gravel pits by my house and pretend I was building nice sandy roads. <span>(Ok, so I’m not doing a great job of selling Wisconsin here, am I?!)</span> I attempted to build pea gravel castles, but somehow it just never worked. Then, on TV, you’d see these amazing intricate sand castles. I really wanted to be involved with that. I didn’t want to move, though.</p>

    <p>I did the next best thing: I researched sand castle building. I have seen pictures of some really detailed castles. One that particularly caught my eye was a three story sandcastle between some palm trees. </p>

    <p>I wondered how anyone was able to build a sand structure so tall. I figured that maybe because it was next to a palm tree they could climb the tree and continue to build while hanging from wires and ropes. They would need their tools on very long poles to reach all sides of the castle, though. Another thought I had involved some really tall step ladders. Perhaps a 3 story a-frame ladder would be used to raise the sculptor to the proper height. This seemed dangerous, though. Also, wouldn’t the ladder start to sink into the sand? By reading more, I finally found out how they built these great castles!</p>

    <p>But first, let’s talk about how programming projects can fail. In software creation, there are two different paths to take: innovation and stabilization. The requirements are gathered and the software is created. This is the innovation part. New features are created and the software is now the newest and innovative version of itself. This is where it gets difficult.</p>

    <p>When there is momentum in a project, it’s very easy to remain solely in the innovation path. That is to say, once new features are created, build on top of them to make even more features. Innovate, create, expand: that’s the software battle cry! There is a second, equally as important path to take now, though: stabilization.</p>

    <p>Stabilization comes in many forms. A recognizable example of this for programmers would be bug fixes. After software is released to the consumer, bugs invariably pop up. Part of the stabilization path is to fix these bugs. Other forms of stabilization are testing different markets and customer types, running A/B tests on interface designs, and evaluating the effectiveness of the newly created features.</p>

    <p>But this stuff is boring! Let’s move forward with new features! This is where the failure begins. You’re adding more and more features to an unstable base where no bugs were fixed and no features were tested. Before you know it, this previously innovative software is now a slow, feature dense <span>(see how I didn’t say feature-rich)</span> product that slowly creeps along. Now, trust-eroding bugs appear, the software stops performing, and the business either flops or the initial product is forced to be rewritten. <span>(Trust me, as much as you’d like to do it, almost always fully rewriting software is a bad idea.)</span></p>

    <p>This is where the competitive sandcastle builders kick our butt as programmers. They’ve implemented a perfect balance of the two paths and have both amazing and durable products in the end. How do they do it?</p>

    <p>When a multi-level sandcastle is being built, the bottom level is created first. Basic layout, shapes, and architecture is created. It is far from a refined product. When the very basic is finished, sandcastle builders use wood to shore up all the sides of the current level, creating a stable platform for the next level. The process is repeated for the second level. Generally, the sculptor never has to use a ladder, long stick, or any sort of ropes or pulleys off of a nearby palm tree. Once at the top, more detail is applied. The artist stands on this nice stable platform built of sand and wood to create a very polished top level. Once the highest part is complete, each lower support is removed and the same amount of detail is applied to that level. Finally, when the builder is on the ground level, the details are finished and the sandcastle is now complete. </p>

    <p>This same process should be implemented when we develop software. Create the initial features and stabilize them. Then, build on top of that and stabilize. When this iteration of the product has all of the features that are planned, continue back down the stable stack tweaking and refining the architecture and features. At the very bottom of the project, then, you’ll have a fully featured, amazing, refined and stable product that had little risk of bugs the entire time. Or, you can tie yourself to a palm tree and see what happens.</p>

    <p>It’s your duty to make sure that both paths are followed during the product development cycle. This can be easier said than done, though. It can be difficult when you have a client or a boss that keeps pushing you to do a new innovation without investing in the stabilization portion. In the short term, sticking to your guns can be hard and may not make you a lot of friends. What makes you the better programmer is how you demonstrate your commitment to quality over the long term. By forcing a period of stabilization, you will be saving the product owner from headaches in the future. It is your responsibility as a professional to make sure you do what is best for your customer, even when they might not realize what that is. Remember, if they knew how to do this and what was best, they wouldn’t be asking you to do it.</p>

    <p>I need to temper this with a bit of realism and associated business impact, however. There are times when the customer or boss may know and fully understand the risks involved with not stabilizing the product. As the programmer, you need to investigate and dig in to find out if they really do understand the risks involved with pushing forward. Make sure that it is a deep understanding and not just a surface level comprehension of “something bad could happen.” Work with them to define what “bad” means and what the cost and repercussions are. </p>

    <p>In business, some success is had by taking risks. There may be times when the cost and the potential reward is greater to the software owner than the risk involved. This is something you must do your best to understand as well. Please make sure that your client or boss has all of the possibilities and relevant information in the case that they ignore your strong plea to continue on the stabilization path.</p>

    <p>Telling programmers to ignore the requests of a boss or client can be a very dicey bit of advice to give. Let me just rephrase what I’m telling you to do. The successful project is one that is balanced with innovation and stabilization. You should do all that is in your power to make sure both paths are balanced. </p>

    <p>Sometimes programmers can get carried away - and you just smiled because you’ve done this yourself. You may want to just keep innovating and applying the newest features. I’m cautioning you against this, do not be the driver of all innovation. Make sure you balance projects in which you have control between both paths. In projects where you are not the primary decision maker, you still want to make every effort to make sure that both paths are followed. In this case, your primary objective must be to provide all relevant information to the decision maker regarding the best practices to follow. Let them know in a non-emotional, very specific way what the quantifiable risks are for ignoring the stabilization path.</p>

    <p>In the end, once you start applying both paths to your projects, you’ll have a large track record of successes that simply can’t be ignored.</p>
