    <h1>#31. Always Be Perfect <small>In our industry, there is no airbrush</small></h1>

    <p>Throughout my career, I’ve had some pretty great bosses. Sadly, I’ve also had some poor ones. In either case, I still remember looking up to them. These were the men and women who made the choices that affected my work life. They had great power. They had my respect.</p>

    <p>And then, they each invariably made a mistake. I was appalled. How could my manager have made such a huge oversight? Or an even worse reaction: “why is my boss being so dumb?” I wanted them to be perfect. I needed them to be perfect. Who wants to be lead by someone who make mistakes just like you do?</p>

    <p>This feeling is something you need to remember when you become a manager. You’re no longer the programmer who can have bugs and forget things. You’re expected to be above this. You’re expected to be perfect. Your team will now expect that you’re impossibly perfect. Keep this in mind when you make your decisions. </p>

    <p>Now is the time to turn on spell-check. A manager can’t have spelling mistakes in his email. Don’t you dare jumble the letters of an acronym. </p>

    <p>Now is the time to look up words you use but you aren’t completely certain of their meanings. Don’t fully know what the acronym SaaS means? Look it up before you use it again. Do you have a habit of using the word “indubitably” but don’t know what it means? You just think it sounds cool? Time to look it up.</p>

    <p>Now is the time to read the books on personality style and management training. That split second after you became a manager, you’re now expected to know all of these things. Of course this is impossible, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. It’s now your new set of responsibilities. Take the time to educate yourself on people and processes.</p>

    <p>We all know that we can never be perfect but we need to keep this unreachable expectation in mind. Make all decisions and choices as if your whole world on display. Your team definitely is watching your every move now. </p>

    <p>Having a team that expects you to be perfect isn’t such a bad thing. This accountability can be leveraged into a good thing. Acknowledge that you’re not perfect, but share that it is your goal to be the highest quality and caliber that you can be. Remember, your team is counting on you to reach these heights, so use that to motivate yourself. You’d be surprised, when no one expects someone to be good, it is easy to be subpar. When others are expecting, encouraging, and challenging you, even us normal folks develop insatiable desires to reach greatness. We have a support system now. We have people rooting for us. Being great isn’t something that is reserved for those crazy people with the insane internal drive anymore. You can do it now, too.</p>

    <p>When you become the manager, you are expected to be perfect. You never will be. Acknowledge this. But, take every care to reach a higher level, learn more, and become more accurate. People are watching you. Be an example of what you’d expect of your manager, and what you’d like your team to emulate.</p>
