    <h1>#19. Social Capital Is Just as Important As Skill <small>Does CompTIA offer certifications in “people like me?”</small></h1>

    <p>We all work on teams. This is an easy concept for those who are actually in a programming team at an organization or company. It’s a bit more difficult for the lone-wolf, the freelancer. But your team is just composed differently. Your team is made up of other freelancers who have similar skills to you. Sometimes these are your competitors; sometimes they can augment your projects with different skills. Point being, we all have team members.</p>

    <p>Within those teams, leaders and followers emerge. Generous team members and leeches are discovered. Programmers who light up a room or make those in an email conversation smile and those that suck the life out of everyone. I think it’s pretty obvious which you should aim to be.</p>

    <p>As you make inroads to become one of these positive members of the team, you develop something I call Social Capital. Similar to the value of money, it is not measured in dollars and cents. This represents the favors that you can call in. This is the ability to speak and have people listen to you. This capital is gained from your social circles, your network, and your team.</p>

    <p>I’ve met some really good programmers. They are super talented at what they do. But, beyond that, they can’t save the world. No one I know is a specialist at everything. None of us have infinite time. These really good programmers are still struggling to become great and successful, missing deadlines and not getting the respect they deserve. Why? </p>

    <p>Because while they have mastered their skill, they hadn&#8217;t banked Social Capital. Or even worse, they don’t see the value in this capital. That’s what this chapter is about.</p>

    <p>A significant amount of your time is spent learning the skills in your particular programming arena. What separates the good from the great programmers is the amount of time spent on developing their social capital. Great programmers invest in Social Capital. These are the people who contribute to open source software, that organize non-profit conferences, and are the first ones to answer questions on collective sites like Stackoverflow. They’ve mastered the concept of Social Capital.</p>

    <p>On a cursory glance, however, it looks more like they’re just generous or altruistic. But this isn’t the case. They’re banking up this capital because they’ve learned the lesson and see the value. And, you should be too.</p>

    <p>What’s the use of having such a bank? What do you spend it on? Do you really need favors?</p>

    <p>I can think of two, somewhat related reasons why this capital matters: the too-big contract and the too-evil boss.</p>

    <p>The too-big contract is that gravy ship that you can’t turn away. It’s just out of reach because you don’t have enough time or enough skill and resources to meet all of the requirements. You know that if you can find a way to solve this one big problem, the rest is going to be exactly in your wheelhouse and you will have a great client for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <p>Now, you have already probably figured out that you can outsource the tasks that you don’t know. If you’ve done this before, you know that outsourcing can be a pain. How do you know the quality of the people you will work with? Are their rates going to be affordable? Do you want to base all of your success on a complete stranger?</p>

    <p>This is where you cash in that Social Capital. Know another freelancer? Cash in that favor and have them join your team for just this task. Normally, they might be too busy or have higher rates than you can afford. However, since you’ve developed this relationship with them, they may be more willing to work for you at a rate that you can budget for this project. And, as an added bonus, because they owe you <span>(in a sense)</span>, you know that they will want to do their best work for you. It’s still business, they’re still making good money, but all this extra work you put into developing your social capital with them has guaranteed a partner to get you through this one tough patch. </p>

    <p>I know this works. I have one particular designer that I work with in this manner. He has a freelance business where he’s more than busy. When he gets stuck or has a question about HTML5, Javascript, or setting up new servers, I’ll help him. He always offers to pay me, but I decline. I’m happy to build this relationship with him, helping him, banking up my social capital. And, in turn, every once in awhile when I want to create a new startup venture which I’m bootstrapping <span>(see: I have no money)</span>, he’s the first one I will call to design the product. Even more demonstrative of this relationship, once he hears about my projects, he’s the first one to offer to step in even before I ask. I don’t offer to pay him, he doesn’t ask. But, if I were working for a paying client, I’d pay him a fair rate. <span>(He shouldn’t have to do stuff for me for free - I don’t expect work for free from my colleagues.)</span> Since I value his quality, his vision, his attention to detail so much, when my project has money I’ll pay for his time without question. And I know that I’m guaranteed his best work because of all the social capital I’ve built up with him. <span>(If you’re honest, when’s the last time you did your best work for say&#8230; a family member? Yeah, probably not. You did good work, but not your best. Either that, or I’m just a horrible person and you are much better than I!)</span></p>

    <p>I try not to drop the “I’m a boss” bomb in this book, but I need to now. I manage a group of programmers and designers. This leads me into my second reason why Social Capital is important. </p>

    <p>I’m going to share a secret. My team might hate me if they read this <span>(or when I force them to read this book and tell me how awesome I am.)</span> One thing some managers do, myself included, is to assign a task that we know is too complex, too long, or too technically advanced for a programmer to complete. I do it here and there. My expectation is that the programmer or designer will step up their game to solve this task. Then, when we reflect on this “impossible” task that they’ve created, they are now the proud architect. And, as a result, they’ve grown, learned, and become a better programmer. </p>

    <p>There’s no feasible way for these programmers or designers to do the task that I assigned them on their own in the timeframe I’ve allowed. It’s nearly if not completely impossible. However, since they work on a team, I know that they can lean on each other to work out the tough tasks. Now, mind you, each one of the team members has their set of tasks with a deadline they should not miss. Because of this, if they help another team member, they put their own projects in danger of going late.</p>

    <p>But, they always do help each other. And for the most part, all projects get on time and on budget. You might say this is just an example of teamwork, and I would agree to some extent. But, it’s also a cyclical demonstration of the advantage of building the social capital among the team members. One programmer might help another three or four times over the next few projects, but knows that they can cash in that favor next time their own timeline is tight. </p>

    <p>From a management point of view, I try to do the same thing. I have a full time job managing the team. However, from time to time, I’ll invite team members out for a meal or a drink on my own dime. Or, I’ll join them in programming some of the project. I hope to help them advance their timetable or catch them up if they’re behind. Because I do these things, I’ve develop a relationship with my team that is returned both in quality work and loyalty. I’ve invested in social capital and I see it returned in so many ways.</p>

    <p>As a programmer, it can be easy to fall into the trap of just being the best at your skillset. Accolades and fame fall from the sky as you become a technology leader. However, the next best thing is always on the horizon, someone is always smarter. Great programmers invest in their trade while simultaneously investing in social capital. Go the extra mile, give, lift up other programmers, and the results will be returned to you in multiples you may never expect.</p>
