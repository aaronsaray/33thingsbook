    <p><strong>Hello.  My name is Aaron Saray, and I.. am a Programmer.</strong></p>
    <p>I know - that just sounded like an admission of guilt.  And, partially, it was.  I'm guilty of a lot of mistakes, bugs, and failures.</p>
    <p>But instead of feeling sorry for myself and burying my head in the sand, I paid close attention to the ups and downs of my programming career and decided to compile my lessons-learned in this online book.</p>
    <p>My goal is simple: I want to make sure that other programmers <span>(like you?)</span> don't make the same mistakes as I did.  If I can save you just one mistake, one problem, one sleepless night, then the years putting this book together have been worth it.</p>
    <p>Are you ready to find out what the <em>33 Things I Wish Somebody Would Have Told Me</em> before I began my programming career?</p>
