    <h1>Managers</h1>

    <p>There are tons of great books out there that are written by people with more training and more experience than I have regarding proper management. I’ve read some of them and they helped me formulate myself into the manager I am today. This section is not a replacement for them.</p>

    <p>Instead, this section is aimed at managers with a technical background. I’m going to communicate some of the most important things I learned about managing a group of programmers and interweave that with my experiences as a programmer.</p>

    <p>Just because you’re a programmer now doesn’t mean you should skip out on this section. I would encourage you to read this as well. You never know how these things will apply to your work now and in the future.</p>

    <p>If you were promoted from programmer to manager, this is for you. If you’re just new to managing a programming team, this is for you. If you’ve read every management book under the sun, this is still for you. You may see parallels in what you’ve read, but the added spin of being from a development background is the extra qualification that will really put you over the top as a great manager.</p>
