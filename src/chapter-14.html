    <h1>#14. Catch Your Breath <small>Relax. Chill out. Unclench those fists. Make your bottle of ibuprofen last longer!</small></h1>

    <p>Sometimes I’m afraid to start out with cliche names. “Catch Your Breath” is often used for so many things, you probably have no idea what this chapter will be about. Should I be taking the time to relax on the beach when I get home from work? Should I be planning time to play catch-up at intervals in my project? Maybe should I stop talking to the client so much and just listen to them?</p>

    <p>All of these things. Catch your breath, in every situation.</p>

    <p>Because software development and technologies change at a fever pitch, programmers are almost always rushed to follow. The newest technology comes out, and you must know that software, immediately! <span>(It’s even worse if you have a boss or a client who has been ‘sold’ on this new technology by an outside consultant or 3rd party and now believes you must have this feature in your product.)</span> It can also be a challenge to take a break from the project. It has to be done 3 days ago, so we need to work 24/7 on it. And if you’re like me, you’ve been in meetings with stakeholders that can’t seem to articulate exactly what they want. It can be really easy to try to finish their thoughts and sentences for them so you can get out of the meeting and back to work! </p>

    <p>How about you just take a breath?</p>

    <p>Let me address the three scenarios now in a little bit more detail.</p>

    <p>First of all, innovators need to innovate. That’s how we get new software, products and techniques. This is necessary and awesome. However, that’s not the path for most of us. Our innovation comes from business process support and growth, not just using and creating new technology for technology’s sake. </p>

    <p>Most of us are allowed to take a breath. It is just as important to have a good base with whatever technology you’re using as well as keeping up with the newest technology. </p>

    <p>I used to be at odds with college degrees. I didn’t think they were really necessary in our field. This was further compounded by a colleague of mine coming to work with me on my team. He had a computer science degree, but he knew nothing and was nearly useless on our team when he started. I had to teach him even the basics of developing and deploying our software. Those 4 years of college, what worth were they? Not until maybe a year and a half later did he finally tell me he was starting to see the importance of his education related to what we were doing. He finally got to a point where he was doing a little bit more advanced programming using proper architecture and design patterns. He mentioned that some of these things he was doing now were what was taught to him theoretically in college. Only after all this time did he finally have some context and appreciation for the base that he was taught.</p>

    <p>I think we both reached the same conclusion. There was indeed value in his degree in computer science. He had the base, he just didn’t have any exposure to the practical technology side. I think we were able to finally discover this realization because we used the same technology for the past 1 and a half years. He was able to specialize more in the actual technology and programming and wasn’t distracted by needing to learn the next greatest technology. He had the time to catch his breath and therefore relate his theoretical knowledge to his daily programming. He had time to reflect on his tasks instead of always pushing forward with something new. </p>

    <p>Even though we focused on the same technology for years, our products didn’t suffer. We were able to continually produce high quality, sustainable, fully featured products for the business without introducing new technology. There was plenty of room in our current toolset to exceed expectations. </p>

    <p>Because I forced the team and my new programmer to take a breath, we drew a strong link to the value of the computer science degree. Now, this programmer learns new technology, but has a very large wealth of base theory to integrate into each new technology. He is on his way to becoming an expert in this field. Since we took that breath, and didn’t run to the newest, next technologies <span>(spending time learning new things, reading tutorials, etc)</span>, we were able to produce better, higher quality products for the company. I am certain that we wouldn’t have been able to reach the level of mastery in programming and stability in our programs without this breath we took.</p>

    <p>The next concept related to catching your breath is the strategic break from work. I’ve touched on this before when referring to ‘do something different.’ However, this is slightly different. Instead of doing something different, just don’t do anything. Breathe. </p>

    <p>When we look at our ancestors, many people focus on the food and meals <span>(in dieting books)</span> or the community structures <span>(for psychology and sociology study)</span>. I would point to a third part: Look at how they spent their day. From what we can guess, our ancestors spent a lot of time hunting or gathering food. Then, they made their own clothes, tools, housing, etc. However, when they were finished with this, what did they do? Did they play XBox or continue hunting for fun? Naw. They made fires, shared food, told stories and just relaxed in their community.</p>

    <p>That’s the key. They relaxed. They had a hard life; they needed to really be on their game when the time was right. It’s sad that we’ve lost touch with this. Now, instead of having that time to relax, rejuvenate, and catch your breath, we measure success by our ability to work more. As we get older both our bodies and our ability to do certain tasks deteriorate. Some blame this on our society values. Others blame it on our poor diet. I think both can be true. But, we’re also forgetting to take a breath. Relax, take a breath. Work will be there. Taking the time to catch this breath will make sure that you’re more efficient anyway. And who doesn’t want to get the same done with less effort!? Don’t forget the lessons of our ancestors.</p>

    <p>Finally, when working with a client or stakeholder, take a breath. Listen to them explain what they want. Don’t try to finish their descriptions and thoughts for them. This almost always works out poorly. Instead, relax, take a breath, and listen to them. Let me give you a great example from one of my colleagues.</p>

    <p>This friend was doing a freelance website for a small business owner. The business owner had a smaller budget which would get them a quality, small, simple website. In the end, that’s all they wanted. However, they took a while explaining what they wanted.</p>

    <p>At some point, the client said a phrase that really derailed the requirements gathering meeting: “I want something unique on my website, that none of my competitors have&#8230;” At this point, my friend broke in talking about the most recent technology he had learned about. The business owner seemed confused. In the end, probably out of frustration and confusion, the client agreed that the new technology was a necessity in his website.</p>

    <p>When all the planning and quoting was done, the freelancer presented a project that was roughly 1.5 times the entire budget the client had proposed. A majority of this cost was associated with the new technology that needed to be applied. </p>

    <p>As you might guess, the freelancer didn’t win the contract. A competitor did win the contract, though. I have a good feeling that they listened better to the client thoroughly. The end result was a website that my friend could have done definitely within the budget of the client. We both agreed that the suggested feature to make the website new and unique using new technology was the reason why he lost the contract. He should have just caught his breath and listened to the client.</p>

    <p>Here’s the real funny part. We discovered what the “something unique” was after a couple months. In the business owner’s industry, the colors that most signify a successful vendor were green and white. The unique thing about the new website was the addition of purple as a featured color. Purple was the unique thing and the only thing the client wanted.</p>

    <p>Seriously, take a breath.</p>

    <p>Part of being a great programmer is understanding the importance of catching your breath. Whether it&#8217;s letting the client explain their needs, mastering technology instead of incessantly acquiring new technology, or relaxing - just a little bit - after work, these things will help good programmers be great.</p>
