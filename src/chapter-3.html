    <h1>#3. Programmers are Customer Service <small>But someone forgot their hair net and rubber gloves</small></h1>

    <p>I used to work as a family-style banquet waiter. I would bring out large trays of food and serve from head table down the sides. Never would fail, by the time I got to the last grouping of people, they were irritated. Why did we have to wait this long for our food? As I listened to their complaints, I couldn’t help thinking “you know, I’m pretty certain that you’ve eaten before&#8230; and that you’ve had at the very least one other meal today.” </p>

    <p>The restaurant customers seemed to have no respect for me. They treated me like garbage. I couldn’t believe the attitude that some of them had with me. Just because I am serving you doesn’t mean you should treat me as if I’m second rate or scum. I wondered how many of these people had ever been in a service industry before. I found out later that some of the customers were lawyers or financial planners. I couldn’t believe they would treat a fellow customer service provider this way.</p>

    <p>As I learned more about the various groups of people who came to my restaurant, I began to realize that a lot of them had ‘family money’ or had been put into their positions by default. They never had to start ‘at the bottom’ - that is, the place that they seemed to think I was at. These men and women had lost the wisdom of our elders that proclaimed that to truly serve another human being is a privilege. The act of one person choosing of their own free will to meet the needs of another is to be respected.</p>

    <p>As my career goes on, I look back at these memories with a particular fondness. I recognize that those experiences had shaped me in ways I am still discovering. For example, if you are now currently in a customer service job that allows for tipping, you can tell others who have had similar jobs. At the restaurant, the patron far removed asks friends or uses a calculator to figure out exactly what that 18% mark should be <span>(or some do less!)</span>. Generally, you can recognize your fellow restaurant veterans by the quick way they calculate the tip: move the decimal one spot, multiply by 2, and make sure that’s the least amount left on the table. That simple act of 20% tipping, or more in some cases, is usually a sign of someone who has been there before and understands the demands and the importance of good customer service.</p>

    <p>As a software developer, you might not yet draw the correlation of these stories to your daily project work. After all, while the restaurant server is bringing food to the table and cleaning up, you are actually creating something out of nothing. Your thought, your design, your artistry creates a piece of software that wasn’t previously available. If you’re on the cutting edge, you may be even creating software and algorithms that have literally never existed before in human history. You label yourself as a product producer.<br>
        You are wrong.</p>

    <p>All programmers are in customer service. We are the epitome of customer service. Let me describe what I mean. A good portion of software is meant to simplify or automate other processes or systems that already exist. Your customer is asking you to refine their business process or vehicle. Think of it as taking your car to the mechanic to get a tune-up. Your mechanic isn’t going to give you a brand new car, he’s just going to make sure this one works better, faster, and more reliable <span>(and call you on your lies like mine did!)</span>. This is what you are doing as a software developer. The purchaser of your software already has a business, you are just creating something to propel it further and faster.</p>

    <p>Depending on your industry, however, you may be making a brand new solution to a problem by creating a new piece of software and defining the process in which it can work. However, I still insist that you are customer service. The root of this statement again is that you’re solving a problem. If it weren’t for people who had a problem, you wouldn’t be creating a solution. Once again, you are serving your customers with a service solution. If they didn’t need this service, you’d not be in business.</p>

    <p>There are many examples of software that were made without a clear solution to a problem. These entrepreneurs or programmers lost sight of the main goal: provide a customer service solution. They may have made an amazing product, but since it wasn’t serving a customer need, it lost steam after its initial release. Before you know it, the non-customer-service-centric business failed.</p>

    <p>When you look at this book in its entirety, you’ll actually realize these are just chapters on increasing your level of customer service. In the same way that we’re likely to appreciate a boutique with knowledgeable salespeople or generously tip our favorite coffee house, the same goes for programming. Your job is to go the extra mile. Not only should you be solving the problem that client has asked for, but you should also be looking for ways to continue to serve them better. </p>

    <p>Expanded customer service comes in two forms, both profitable. The first is the most clear to understand: the upsell. While you’re solving the problem for the client, evaluate the rest of their processes that your customer has made visible to you. Consider if you can make improvements to help save the customer even more time and money. You may want to offer them that service as an extra <span>(a veritable “would you like fries with that?”)</span>. </p>

    <p>Here’s the kicker: don’t offer to just fix the problem, but take the guesswork out of it for them. Describe the problem you can solve, state your solution, and give them the benefits of implementing the solution. For example, you may say that you noticed that their representatives could spend up to 20% of their day using an old, outdated software interface. You could update this interface to make it easier to use, therefore shaving an estimated 50% off of the time each representative spends accomplishing a task. This reduces the amount of time spent to 10% of the day, realizing a 10% savings and productivity boost over their entire staff. How can they say no to that? That’s an upsell, securing more work for you. Better than that, you’ve solved another problem for them. That’s customer service.</p>

    <p>The second form of expanded customer support in the programming world is simply exceeding expectations. I’ve seen both right and wrong examples of this. First, let’s start with the wrong example. A colleague of mine was creating a new website for a non-profit organization. He really felt passionate about their mission, so he not only created the website, but built a donation interface using PayPal too. All this for free! The client didn’t realize this new addition at first. Days later, they did - and it was very bad. They had not yet finalized the paperwork creating their non-profit organization and tax-deductible donation status, but had received donations to their PayPal account already. The interface had falsely told donors that they could claim a deduction on their taxes for this donation. The client was obviously irritated that they now had to contact those donors and let them know about their current situation. The donations were not tax-deductible yet. This programmer had tried to exceed expectations, but he had done it in the wrong way. Needless to say, he has not been contracted to do any more work for them.</p>

    <p>There is a right way to exceed expectations, however. A friend of mine was working with a client who had a rather small budget. Because of this, they were generally fine with fixes and updates being applied in a queue mixed with other higher paying clients. The client understood that sometimes their fixes would take a few days, even if they appeared to be urgent. One Friday night, however, the client discovered a bug on the website. He contacted my friend via email to let him know about it. By now, the relationship was established, expectations were set, and the client knew it may take a few days to get the fix applied <span>(especially since it was the weekend)</span>. However, my friend happened to have some time available, so he fixed the problem that night, sent a follow-up email, and invoiced the client. </p>

    <p>As usual for this particular client, the invoice was paid immediately. The owner responded to the follow-up email with nothing but the highest praise for the work that was done on a Friday night. My friend had truly exceeded expectations and made the client very happy. It doesn’t end there, though. A few days later, my friend received a letter in the mail from the client thanking him again for his quick work. Included in the letter was a $250 gift card to a local home improvement store.</p>

    <p>This particular outcome is a rather unique one. The only other similar scenario that comes to mind was of a colleague who was once presented with a disposable cooler full of fresh steaks. Regardless of if you see an immediate material return, the main point is to exceed customer expectations through great customer service no matter what. This will help make the difference between choosing you in the future to do the job or trusting you to run a huge project and going a different route. What’s even better is the indirect outcome from this great service: when you increase your rates or ask for a raise, it’s much easier to stick with you than to attempt to find someone else who may not have the level of service you provide.</p>

    <p>I think its incredibly important to approach every programming task as a new foray into the realm of customer service. Remember, if these customers didn’t have these service needs, we wouldn’t have jobs. </p>
