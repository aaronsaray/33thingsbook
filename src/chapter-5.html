    <h1>#5. Have Pride in Your Work <small>For the tenth and final time, yes, you are really, really good at double clicking</small></h1>

    <p>I’ve said it many, many times. Show me a programmer who was never behind on a project and I’ll show you a liar. There’s always going to be times when a task takes longer than expected, something comes up, or there just isn’t the possibility of completing the task in the original bounds. There are many ways to solve this problem.</p>

    <p>When you’re behind on a project, you could talk with the client or stakeholders and request an extension. You may be able to explain what happened, give them an insight into the new difficulties, or work out a feature compromise. Maybe that’ll work.</p>

    <p>Another way to catch up on a project is to cut corners. Instead of writing unit tests, skip them. Do not create any documentation. If you’re not as familiar with the proper way of doing something, just fall back on old, less accurate methods. Maybe that will catch up the project.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you’ll find a programming genie, and your wishes will be granted. Back on time! </p>

    <p>This chapter isn’t about how to catch up on a late project or program. I’m not going to tell you what is the best way to stay on task. This chapter is about something else I want to stress: pride in your work.</p>

    <p>Whenever you can, resist the urge to cut corners. Remember, this code <span>(and art)</span> you’re creating is a reflection of you. Imagine if your mom or dad understood what you were doing <span>(perhaps they do, and then you’re incredibly lucky)</span>, would they be proud of it? Would you be willing to show your programming mentor this work? Would you like hundreds of thousands of fellow programmers to download your code and use it? If you feel squeamish about any of these questions, you may be cutting corners.</p>

    <p>Way back in elementary school, I learned the value of having pride in your work. I don’t remember the specific teacher or class, but I remember the story. The class had finished homework and turned it in at the beginning of class. The teacher looked through all of our work, graded it, and handed it back to each of us. I remember not having the best grasp of the material, but I did the best I could. After the homework was handed back, many students looked visibly upset.</p>

    <p>The teacher stood in front of class and said, “with the exception of Aaron and [some other student], I don’t think any of you have any pride in your work. I gave you the grades you did based on both the answers you gave and the quality of your work. If you’d like, you can redo this assignment for a higher grade.” After class, I compared notes with other friends. While I had more errors than many of them, I had one of the highest grades of my peers. I had been rewarded for trying my hardest and taking pride in my effort. I opted not to redo my homework, but I did study more to try to learn the answers to the questions I had got wrong.</p>

    <p>As primarily an open source programmer, it is very important for me to have pride in my work. Many people download my projects, review the source code, and implement it in their projects or at their company. I need to make sure I do the best I can. I’ve been on the receiving side of poor work many times and it’s not fun. Whether it’s undocumented code, no help or FAQ, or poor logic and structure, programmers who didn’t have pride in their work just seemed to have lower quality projects.</p>

    <p>Even if you’re not an open source programmer, you may run into future colleagues that have had the joy to work on your code. You will have gained more respect, even if you had bugs in your code, by having created very accurate, ordered, precise code that you are proud of. Hitting deadlines is important, but pride in your work is paramount. When you create quality work you’re proud of, you’ll see the ramifications everywhere. Peers will know that you are someone who can produce good code and are happy to work with you. Managers and clients will know that the product they get from you is of the highest quality and caliber. </p>

    <p>Have pride in your work. Your work is a reflection of you. And while it may not seem like it at the time, this investment always comes back to reward you - or haunt you - depending on which path you choose.</p>
