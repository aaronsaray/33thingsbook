    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>When I was very little, I thought I wanted to be a mathematician. I can’t remember exactly why, but I think it had something to do with multiplication tables. Or, perhaps, because of the timed tests where I solved one hundred addition problems in sixty seconds. My father told me a story from his childhood where he broke off the corner of a 6 sided die and then rolled it hundreds of times. He kept track of the result in a notebook. He was very interested in how changing the shape of the die affected the results. Maybe I inherited math skills from him <span>(one of the better traits, but, I’d love to give back the snoring and bad eyesight)</span>.</p>
    <p>I was also very fond of Tinker Toys, Lincoln Logs, and Legos. I enjoyed building things, I was good at math. Perhaps I was on the path to being a structural architect?</p>

    <p>During the 80’s recession <span>(and afterward)</span>, our family was very poor. I had a few toys, but my prized possession was the hand-me-down Commodore 64/Vic20. This computer was pretty awesome. I mean, it was, if you had a hard disk, removable diskette system, printer, tape drive, or anything besides just the core machine. Mine, however, hooked into an old black-and-white TV and booted to a screen that simply said “Ready.” I had no games, no permanent storage, and only a complicated manual describing the BASIC language. If I wanted to play Blackjack, I’d have to program it myself.</p>

    <p>I did just that. When other 8-year-old children were still fantasizing about the newest MicroMachines and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figures they could collect, I was programming Blackjack, a pong-like program, and even “Go fish.” And, I was living in supreme dread over thunderstorms. You know, thunderstorms - those great summer treats that knock out the power in rural Wisconsin fifty percent of the time. No power meant losing my program and having to start over. Oh, and I just hope that I had a chance to write in my college-ruled notebook all of the tens of thousands of lines of code to this latest game. If not, I’d be giving a new meaning to “rewriting” the software. </p>

    <p>Yet, I still loved it. I loved everything about computers. I was able to use my building and architectural planning talents and my mathematics skills. <span>(Plus, nowadays, how many Mathematicians do you know? I know I’m crazy, but I kind of like options when I’m picking a job.)</span> To this day, I still love programming. Any language I can learn, any problem I can solve, I’m ready to take the challenge. I’m here to stay.</p>

    <p>As my career has progressed, I’ve had a lot of chances to work with different teams, join unique companies, and mentor up-and-coming programmers. This diversity has driven home the simple fact: not everybody is like me. Not every programmer has the same talents, skills, and comprehension of processes and procedures. Everyone is different. Some things that seem common sense to me may not be to other programmers. And, of course, vice-versa. </p>

    <p>These differences inspired me to write this book. The topics in this book are backed by years and years of research, and decades of experience - and mistakes. I’m incredibly proud of my journey so far as a programmer and I look forward to the upcoming decades that I have left in this field. I’m excited to see what new technologies my team and I will be leveraging even five years from now. Can you imagine the innovations that are to become common place in seven or ten years from now? While I’m saddened that some of the technologies I’ve learned are now irrelevant <span>(I’m looking at you, BASIC)</span>, I know that I’ll continue learning new technologies to keep myself current.</p>

    <p>But this book isn’t about technologies. If your entire bookshelf is filled with various language and tool technical books, this book is not the competition. This book is about the core concepts of programming that are language agnostic. These are the things you learn from programming in any language, in any role, with any responsibility, project size, and budget. See, while the technology comes and goes, the base skills of being a programmer are the same. Great programmers can swap technologies while continuing to build the core skills of logic, architecture, design, planning, and communication.</p>

    <p>And that’s what this book is for. <em>33 Things I Wish Somebody Told Me</em> is a look back on my career, growing as a programmer, unrelated to each technology I worked with. These are the things that I wish somebody told me. Perhaps if I would have known these things <span>(or read this book back then&#8230; Doc Brown, ready your flux capacitor)</span> I would have had an easier road and would be farther along. </p>

    <p>Basically this is a book to help you escape those embarrassing <strong>“you should’ve known”</strong> or <strong>“you wouldn’t do it like that”</strong> moments. You know exactly what I mean - when the boss or the senior programmer points to your code or software, everyone’s staring at you, and your face suddenly flushes. Wow - is it hot in here?</p>

    <p>This book covers both technical process concepts as well as some mental abilities that any successful programmer needs to have. No matter what your chosen language is or where you fall in the experience ladder of programming <span>(or even managing programmers)</span>, you can always get better. We can always get better.</p>

    <p>I took a deep look at both my successes and failures to create the topics for this book. I am passionate in my quest to help mentor and educate other programmers to be successful. I’m hoping to help groom programmers to become great.</p>

    <p>These are the <em>33 Things I wish Somebody Told Me</em>.</p>

    <h2>The Voice of This Book</h2>

    <p>Some of my best friends are also my co-workers. I mean, I do have some non-nerd friends, but most of them are big geeks just like myself. They think about code even when they should be relaxing. They envision redesigns for our web applications while watching TV. We help each other out. We all are friends <span>(even though, I technically am the boss for some of them)</span>.</p>

    <p>And, because you, dear reader, are probably also a big geek, I’m going to call you friend as well. We’re friends now. I’ll be talking to you directly. I’m not going to go abstract. You will hear “You should do this” and not “The programmer should do this.” As you can probably tell already, this book’s composition and writing style is a bit more relaxed. I meant it that way. I want to have a conversation with you. In fact, <strong>I hope to hear from you</strong> before, during, and after reading this book. Find me on <a href="http://aaronsaray.com" title="Click it!">aaronsaray.com</a> and let’s chat. Tell me your thoughts. I’d love to clarify anything - and even better, I’d love to hear your success stories from implementing some of the 33 things.</p>

    <p>I’ll tell you a secret about my bookshelf. I’m scared of it. I see some really great books that have some really good theory that I need to crack open. That’s my next step in becoming a more skilled programmer. But, while the information is great, the books themselves are dry and boring. I know the programmers and computer scientists that wrote them are great people, but I just can’t seem to read them cover to cover. After a few minutes, I get distracted. Look - there’s a fly on the wall! Let’s play tug-of-war, dog! What’s new on Netflix. I just can’t stay connected.
        Some publishers understand this problem. I won’t name names, but one of them has put pictures of the writers on the front covers of their books to make the connection with the reader. I mean, now that I can see a black-and-white awkward photograph of the programmer, I’m now going to be much more connected and enthralled with every single page of useful, but somehow still boring, information, right? Sorry! <span>(If you do your research on these books, you’ll see that I REALLY know first hand what I’m talking about.)</span></p>

    <p>In the following pages, there are some great concepts to learn with some technical backing, but that doesn’t mean we have to have a snooze-fest. Since you’ve made the commitment to take time out of your busy schedule to read 33 things about becoming a great programmer, my return on your commitment is two-fold. </p>

    <p>First, I’ll try my hardest to educate with the 33 things. Trust me, these are huge reflections from myself. You’re getting a part of my soul with this book - blood, sweat and tears all went into this. Ok, well not blood. Lots of sweat. Perhaps a tear or two, but that was allergies&#8230; yeah! </p>

    <p>The second thing I guarantee is that I’ll write in a voice that is conversational, story filled, and interesting. I’ll embellish where there’s a need, but cut out the extra BS when it’s not needed. I use stories and my experiences extensively because that’s how I learn. And, I find that a lot of programmers learn this way as well. In the same way that looking at code samples can be used to learn a new language, stories about a programmer’s decisions and consequences are useful. I don’t have a page-count in mind, and that’s a good thing. That means everything in the final product is exactly only what I think needs to be here, written in my true voice. If you read this book, you now know how I talk on a daily basis - whether that’s a positive or negative, I guess I don’t know!</p>

    <h2>Organization of This Book</h2>

    <p>This book has two sections: one for programmers and one for managers of programmers. I thought it was important to include both because I’ve seen a lot of programmers be promoted to managers without having any resources that are aimed at the background where they came from.</p>

    <p>The section for programmers focuses on a number of necessary skills. These range from building social connections and soft-skills, learning to become better technically at your craft, and communicate in ways that show confidence and garner appreciation.</p>

    <p>The managers section is useful for both prior programmers and those with no programming experience. It aims to give information about leading groups of programmers, discovering programmer motivations, and how to interpret actions and events that happen on a development team.</p>

    <p>I would suggest reading both sections, no matter which position your current role is. Both have useful tips and tricks, but with different aims.</p>
