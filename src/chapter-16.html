    <h1>#16. Seek Out Feedback From Peers <small>It’s the most valuable free thing out there</small></h1>

    <p>There are two types of programmers: great programmers who are willing to learn, and jerks. And, I’m guessing you know both kinds.</p>

    <p>The biggest difference between these two is ego and willingness to submit to peer review. Think about it again: that jerk programmer you know, how many times has he asked a fellow programmer for help? As you realize you can count the number of times on no fingers, you may start to really grasp the difference. The non-jerk great programmer? He solicits feedback from his peers.</p>

    <p>Not all of us started out as talented, knowledgeable, and experienced programmers. <span>(I mean, I did. But your mileage may vary.)</span> Perhaps you’re still in the beginner phase, learning new things every day. Perhaps you’ve accomplished a lot and feel rather comfortable and confident in your skillset. Either way, though, you can still benefit from asking for feedback from your peers.</p>

    <p>Asking for feedback and submitting yourself for constructive criticism allows you to grow in a number of ways. The first and potentially most important is that whole “second set of eyes” paradigm. Whenever you get a team of individuals, or at least a partner, on a task, there are bound to be different viewpoints and unique perspectives. The colleagues you’ve asked for feedback will notice bugs that you haven’t caught. They might also help by giving you suggestions based on their own mistakes. In fact, when you humble yourself and ask for advice and feedback, others are more than willing to reveal their own mistakes for the sake of coaching. </p>

    <p>Don’t believe me? Imagine someone asking you to teach them to swing a baseball bat. If you learned this skill by yourself, you probably missed the ball many times. But, finally, you learned how to knock that ball out of the park. Now, imagine a child asking you for help when they begin to learn to play baseball. You can pretty much guarantee you’d be overwhelmed with a desire to teach them all the things you didn’t know. “This is how you swing the bat. Keep your eye on the ball.” All this knowledge is based on the mistakes you made. This is the same in any industry, especially programming. If you ask your peers for feedback, they can not help but give you feedback that will save you from further mistakes.</p>

    <p>When you ask peers for feedback, you’re saying something to their subconscious as well. You’re elevating them to a temporary authority. You’re saying “during this task, I imagine that you know things that I don’t know.” Whether or not you really believe that about the programmer, this is the underlying idea and mentality. When asking for help, you’re looking to someone who has greater resources than you. In this case, you’re subconsciously telling someone they have greater programming prowess than you do. This isn’t a bad thing for you. And there’s even more benefit. It not only boosts the self esteem of your colleague, but it puts them in a position where they actually serve your project by identifying issues and depositing their knowledge, for free!</p>

    <p>The final way that asking for peer review creates impact is quite minimal. But, it’s something you should realize. For some reason, computers have created a number of interesting neurosis in our population <span>(remember “computer panic?”)</span>. There is a concept called “programmer envy.” The act of being a programmer actually requires a lot of underlying competition and desire for success. If you don’t want to be a great programmer, you may not have these goals. But if you do, you want to be the best, and you want to succeed, you have this desire to become better than your peers.</p>

    <p>Because of this competition, programmers develop a subconscious understanding of different levels and roles based on your experience. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re on the bottom rung. You don’t know anything. In a sense, it&#8217;s almost like the military: “come on maggot, you don’t know anything. I’ve put in the time, you haven’t. Step up and learn!” It’s incredibly easy for the more senior programmers to imagine the less experienced as less worthwhile humans. Newbie, you don’t know what you’re doing! </p>

    <p>Want to flip things around? Ask for feedback. Right away. Humbly acknowledge that you’re on your way, learning, and you need their feedback. Not only have you fed the ego of the programmer by putting them on an authority pedestal, you’ve demonstrated that you don’t know everything. You’re more than willing to learn. As a peer, but with different experience, this is how you demonstrate your worth, your ability to be a team player, and your willingness to learn. This whole idea helps change the thought of “this guy sucks” to “this new programmer is willing to learn.”</p>

    <p>Every once in a while, I’ll issue a challenge to some of the web developers on my team. It comes in the package of “solve this simple task.” We all put our code on github gists or pastebin and share it with each other. In this way, we’re asking each other for feedback, all at an equal level. The first time I did it, there was some rumblings of “that way sucks” when reviewing colleagues work. But as time has went on, I’ve actually noticed that each programmer will give positive, constructive feedback. If they think a piece of code can be better, they’ll suggest updates. Others will say things like, “you know, I’ve never thought of doing it that way, that’s cool.” The end result is that I have a group of programmers that are actively asking for feedback, leveling out the playing field, getting rid of extraneous ego, becoming more productive and creating better quality code.</p>

    <p>This task can be done by any programmer in many ways. You can either ask your team to facilitate peer review, ask your senior programmer or boss for custom peer review of code or post your public code on open source websites and ask for feedback. Trust me, this makes you seem like an honest, worthwhile person while enhancing the self esteem of others that may help you - and ending up with a better product from a great programmer.</p>
