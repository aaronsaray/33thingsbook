    <h1>#12. Find Someone Smarter <small>Stephen Hawking need not apply</small></h1>

    <p>For years, I struggled with the decision of whether to frame my certifications and hang them in my office. I didn’t want to be “that guy” who always seemed to brag about himself. But, on the other hand, I was very proud of all the things I had learned. I had been tested, and I had passed. I finally decided to hang them up in my office. I had so many, I ended up having to display them on a shelf as well. If you enter my office now, it really looks like I know what I’m doing. That, or that I’m one of the most conceited managers in the world. Oh, I hope not!</p>

    <p>When I work with my team, I do code reviews and architectural decisions. Each programmer is learning, growing, and becoming truly excellent at their job. However, I am still the leader of the team, helping make the tough decisions, dissecting solutions and making sure our level of quality code remains high. When a programmer gets stuck, they generally will come into my office and sit and talk over the problem with me. Most of the time, I can help lead them to the solution that I think will be best. It doesn’t hurt that we program mainly in PHP and I’m the author of a PHP Design Pattern book.</p>

    <p>In my local area, I also started a PHP Users Group. I see various levels of programmers come and go in our group. They take turns learning from each other and teaching each other. Generally, I don’t pick up much from the presentations, but I enjoy meeting with the people. If I volunteer to give a talk, it tends to be pretty tough for most of the people to follow. Some get lost in the details. Only one or two other programmers seem to feel comfortable asking questions or challenging my solutions.</p>

    <p>I pretty much know everything.</p>

    <p>And, if I really thought that, I’d be the biggest jackass - and you should put down this book immediately. But, that’s not the case.</p>

    <p>I can honestly say that I’ve had those thoughts go through my head a few times, though. I know a lot, there isn’t anyone who can challenge my knowledge, I don’t need to try anymore. </p>

    <p>But, don’t worry, I’ve been brought back down to Earth - a few times!</p>

    <p>While in my somewhat smug attitude years ago, I went to a PHP conference in California. There I met people who created extensions for the PHP language, PECL programmers, and others who specialized in tuning the hardware and software underneath the platform that was running the PHP applications. A lump flew up into my throat as I realized how misguided I had become.</p>

    <p>Compared to these guys, I knew nothing.</p>

    <p>I could have wallowed in my own pity, or at the very least, stuck my head in the sand <span>(ostrich style)</span> and went back home, secure in my bubble. But, I put this next practice into effect instead.</p>

    <p>Always find someone smarter than you! That’s what I’ve done many times, and I’m so happy I did. </p>

    <p>There always is someone smarter than you. For example, if you do PHP like I do, there are people who program C modules for the core. If you are a jQuery rockstar, other programmers specialize in just plain Javascript. If you are a great Mono or Python programmer and can create amazing Linux desktop applications, there are others who work on and submit code for the Linux kernel. There always is someone smarter than you, and that’s ok.</p>

    <p>What’s not ok is ignoring that fact. It’s not ok to pretend like these people don’t exist. You should make contact with smarter people and learn from them.</p>

    <p>This concept really leads into forms of mentorship. Many years ago, I read an article in a business magazine <span>(Remember magazines? Or should I say, have you been to your doctor’s office lately?)</span> that talked about successful entrepreneurs. They focused primarily on Tech companies, so I kept reading. One of the most important things that was mentioned as a game-changer for successful companies was the leadership team having high-quality mentors. The article ended by stating that of all things, the most important thing for an aspiring person in the technology field was to find a mentor. That’s what kicked off my search.</p>

    <p>Throughout the years, I’ve found many smarter people. When I was beginning to learn PHP, I had a great mentor who helped me learn more and challenged me every step. Later, when I got into business, I had a financial mentor who taught me about balance sheets and their importance to a strong organization. I have had mentors who helped me understand how to communicate technology to non-tech stakeholders. I’ve even had mentors that helped me understand the importance of various managerial decisions I’ve made. I’m truly indebted to these mentors as they’ve done two things for me: they’ve pointed me towards a path of success and they helped remind me that there are lots of people smarter than me.</p>

    <p>Do you have a mentor? If so, when’s the last time you thanked them? Remember, there is no rule, requirement, or law that people have to help each other. Mentors happen to see value and potential in those who they build relationships with, and generally give guidance and direction out of the kindness of their own heart <span>(there’s actually a tiny bit more to this, but more on that later)</span>. It’s surprising how much a quick thank you can be appreciated by your mentor. I strongly encourage you to thank them the next time you can. Nothing too spectacular - a quick note, a nice card, or even a Tweet publicly appreciating them is great. In fact, if you have a mentor and you haven’t thanked them, please go do that now! <span>(I’ll wait. Nope. Don’t just put it on your todo list, get up, and do it now.)</span></p>

    <p>If you don’t have a mentor, it’s time to start thinking about one. Who are the people that you know that are smarter than you? And when I say ‘smarter,’ I don’t use just one definition of the word. This person may be more intelligent, or they may have more experience, or just a different insight on the world. Perhaps they’ve been there before. Perhaps they’ve even failed where you might in the future. These are the “smarter than you” people that you should be looking for as your mentor.</p>

    <p>If you don’t know of anyone in your immediate group of friends or colleagues, you should look elsewhere. There are a number of online organizations that support mentor relationships. Take the time to email your heroes in your field and ask for their guidance in finding a mentor. <span>(Fun tip: if you ask someone for help finding a mentor, they may suggest some good resources for you. They might even volunteer themselves. For some reason, my experience is if you directly ask them, they may not be as open. Not sure why this happens, but it has to me. When I asked for help finding mentors, that’s when I opened the floodgates.)</span> Start looking. I’m sure you can find at least one.</p>

    <p>Don’t get discouraged if it takes a while. All good things require effort. Also, don’t get sad if your first mentorship relationship doesn’t work out. I’ve went through a number of mentors in my career so far. Some work out for just a few instances or a short amount of time. Others are longer relationships. <span>(As cheesy as it sounds, I think of mentorships just like the quote on friendship: friends come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.)</span> Just because the relationship ends, doesn’t mean everything was a failure. Any value you got out of the relationship is a measurement of success.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget that the mentor relationship isn’t always defined by that name. Sometimes this person is just someone who you happen to work with, volunteer with, or know just in passing. This doesn’t have to be a formal situation. Sometimes mentors are found in your current relationships, you just didn’t frame it like that. The important point is that you really need to develop a relationship with “someone smarter than you” to continue to be successful.</p>

    <p>On the flip side of finding a mentor is the act of being a mentor. As I mentioned above, mentors will invest time in the relationship mostly out of the kindness of their heart. Perhaps they’re excited to help develop a younger person’s career, love encouraging potential, or just want to pay-it-forward for opportunities that they had. However, there are hidden benefits, too.</p>

    <p>There are many opportunities to learn something from being a mentor. When you’re a mentor, you get exposed to a number of other scenarios that you might not have run into otherwise. Someone is bringing their perspective and challenges to you and asking you to help.</p>

    <p>The mentor gets to learn from this by analyzing different perspectives. Perhaps you’ve only thought of a problem a certain way, but you get to see it in a different light. Another value is the requirement to solidify and analyze the knowledge that you already “know.” This means sometimes there is an underlying idea or concept that you make decisions based on, but when you need to explain it to someone else, you must think about it and package it in a new way. This extra thought forces you to analyze what you know to be true, evaluate it, and possibly expand on it. Then, those ideas get to be challenged by the person you’ve explained it to. This really is a value to the mentor. By continuing to give, they actually get more clarity and understanding of the things that made them successful. I’ve also seen the act of mentorship really reignite passions in those mentors who may have let certain parts of themselves go dormant.</p>

    <p>The best way to learn something really well is to teach it. That’s why I view a mentor as a teacher. Mentors are teaching the things they know to someone else. That forces them to learn it better. </p>

    <p>One of the challenges I put myself through is finding a speaking opportunity with a group of people who may have a need to know about some new technology that I barely know about myself. I volunteer to go speak there and introduce the topic. This forces me to learn about the particular topic or technology. Not only do I need to know the very basics of it, I need to concentrate on those points to clearly communicate them to others who have not learned it, and be ready to answer questions about it. It really forces me to learn the material well. </p>

    <p>To me, this concept is shared with those who are mentors. When you need to demonstrate and teach values to someone else, you really need to know and understand them yourself very thoroughly. You must take time to explain both the what and the why.</p>

    <p>So, no matter what, please go find someone who is smarter than you. If you have that person already, thank them. They’re helping you more than you realize. If you don’t have one yet, go find one. Finally, don’t forget that you can also be that mentor. No matter where you are in your career, there is probably someone who is taking those same steps you did before, and can benefit from your experience and knowledge.</p>
