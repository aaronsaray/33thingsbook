    <h1>#1. Learn From Everything <small>And learn to love the haters</small></h1>

    <p>I don’t know when it happened, but sometime in my life, I suddenly had this feeling that I knew everything. We all experience that sort of feeling here and there in our lives, I’m sure. Perhaps you’ve attained the best or highest level in a particular field, or you are the most talented person on your team at work. You might feel on top of the world, which is not bad. But the bad part is when you start thinking there isn’t more room for growth and that you can’t learn any more.</p>

    <p>You can always learn. But, learning doesn’t always come in traditional vehicles. It seems that most people think of learning as academic laden time wasted. You’ll need to get this book, take this class, do these particular tests, etc. That’s not the case all the time. <span>(Don’t get me wrong, even though I have my student loan payments still looming, I do see some value in the time I spent in the academic world.)</span> But learning comes in all different forms and from many different places.</p>

    <p>I’ve definitely seen this firsthand. My parents used to make great decisions. They taught me things while I grew up that really primed me to make positive decisions and continue to grow my career. Something changed, however, and they started making very poor decisions. Fast forward to now, and I think most would agree that the final product of their combined decisions has lead them into poverty, depression, and bouts with alcoholism. I’ve been very bitter watching this decline. I’m even more upset considering I have two sisters that still live with my parents.</p>

    <p>One of my sisters called me a few months ago and wanted to talk. She lamented about the decisions that my parents had made. She told me about the things that they had told her that she could and should do with her future. She seemed to be of the mindset that mom and dad were a weight holding her down. My first reaction was to agree with her - how dare they make her feel this negatively!</p>

    <p>Luckily, I quickly reframed my thoughts while she was telling me the most recent news in her life. I thought about all the positive things that my parents had taught me. I looked at the completely obvious mistakes that they had made in their lives up until now, and I decided I knew exactly what to say to my sister.</p>

    <p>“You need to imitate the positive things they do and say, learn from their failures, and disregard the rest.” I went on to explain what I meant to her for the rest of the conversation. I described various events that happened while I was growing up, and what I learned from my parents’ reactions. I encouraged her to continue to do the best she could, follow her own path, show her parents respect, and never forget that there is something to learn from even the bad things they said and did.</p>

    <p>I think this type of scenario is something that we can all relate to, whether or not you can relate directly to the sibling/parent dynamic. I highly doubt that there isn’t at least one horrible boss that you’ve had in your career. You’ve probably had downright despicable coworkers as well. That doesn’t mean you should block them out of your mind. Instead, listen to, but do not absorb what they have to tell you, and learn from it.</p>

    <p>At one company I worked at, most of the programmers work remotely. One of my peers was telling me how he pulled in roughly double my salary. I asked him how that was possible. He told me his little secret: He actually worked full time at two jobs at the exact same time remotely. He somehow was able to balance both workloads, while giving 50% effort. He never admitting that he was doing this, and no one seemed to suspect a thing. I found this particularly disrespectful to his employers, and I found that I could never trust him again.</p>

    <p>I did learn something from meeting this programmer, however. Now, as a manager, I make sure everyone on my team knows they can speak openly about other opportunities they have. I learned that programmers may want to take on more responsibility, freelance, or experiment with different technologies. I maintain this open dialog to make sure that everyone is comfortable and that I won’t have people going behind my back to do things. These covert actions only damage our relationships and destroys productivity.</p>

    <p>There are other ways to learn from people, too. I think of a few times I’ve given a final product to a customer and heard the worst words a programmer can hear: “I hate it.” Are you kidding me?! I put in months of my time, my heart, my energy, and my creativity into this product and you quickly tear this all apart with three little words. Especially if you work directly with individual end users, I’m sure you’ve heard this before too.</p>

    <p>Usually the first reaction is defense. You may want to retort that you’ve designed the application or program exactly to their specifications or argue that you weren’t given enough direction. However, that’s going to get you nowhere. Instead, let’s take a look at this from another direction.</p>

    <p>There are just a few, very basic human emotions that are the root of all the ways that we feel. <span>(Warning: I’m not a psychologist, so don’t hunt me down and yell at me.)</span> For me, they boil down to levels of happiness and levels of passion. <span>(For those designery people in the house, think of them as brightness and saturation.)</span> Hate comes from passion. So, when someone tells you in an angered tone that they hate your work, it’s just misdirected passion. I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true.</p>

    <p>So, your job is to figure out what is this customer’s passion. It’s not logical that they would absolutely hate something that you’ve created - most people are not psychopaths or that emotionally unstable. What’s the deal? What is it that they’re passionate about? This is what you may have missed. You didn’t know what they were passionate about, and because of that, you either forgot to emphasize it or left it out entirely.</p>

    <p>During some of my freelance web design career, I came across one particular customer that really helps illustrate this point. After the design had been completed, I met with the customer to show off my work and their new site. As I explained it to them, they looked very unhappy. Finally, when I had finished talking <span>(and I’m sure I talked longer, and then, increasingly more frantic than I should have because of the negative facial expression on my paycheck&#8230; I mean client’s face)</span>, they said those fateful words&#8230; “I hate this design.”</p>

    <p>I knew this couldn’t be the case. I didn’t make horrible “hate-worthy” designs, so I delved in deeper. I told the client that I understood, but I just need to get a little bit more information out of them. I asked if they liked the color scheme and how I featured their logo. That was ok, said the client. Ok, do you like the pages and menu scheme I used? Yup, they said. Finally, I touched on the passion point.</p>

    <p>“Do you like the contact page?”</p>

    <p>“No! I hate how you didn’t ask for the phone number, and why do you have this google map so large on the page! We don’t need them coming here, we just need to talk to them. Remove that!” So I said I completely understood. If I removed that, restructured it to emphasize calling or emailing, should we move forward with the design? Yes, they emphatically responded. </p>

    <p>I had found their passion.</p>

    <p>In this case, the customer was vehemently opposed to having people come to their retail location with customer support issues. They had a whole call-center available for that. The phone number was particularly important because that’s how the relationship was built in their business. I had found out what was important to them, tweaked that messaging, and the whole design was now something they loved. I was able to look into their “hate” for the design, find their passion, and learn.</p>

    <p>Besides serving this customer, I learned even more from this experience. When I designed future contact pages, I thought to ask the customer what kind of contact form they appreciate the most. This helped me feature the primary contact information in a way that helped convert customer complaints and sales opportunities the right way.</p>

    <p>There is always something to learn from every interaction we have with clients, customers, and peers. Remember to always look at these interactions, whether they are positive or negative, as opportunities to learn. Extract the knowledge from the situation, reflect on what you could have done, what you did do, and what you’ll do next time. Learning from everything, not just technical documents and manuals, is what makes a good programmer great.</p>
