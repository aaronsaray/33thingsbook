    <h1>#7. Design for Your Users <small>Stop being selfish. There’s a whole lot more of them and only one of you.</small></h1>

    <p>It is very rare that a programmer will find themselves in a completely siloed world where they never make any decisions about how the user interacts with the software. While you might not be the UI/UX creator, designer of the application, or architect of the process, there are still times when you do make some choices that affect the user interface. So with that in mind, I have something very important to tell you.</p>

    <p>Stop designing like a programmer.</p>

    <p>Seriously, stop it.</p>

    <p>Half of the readers will know exactly what I’m saying. You’ve seen it in your own work. You’ve worked with a great designer or layout specialist and they’ve made tweaks to your design that just made sense. That “Ooooh” moment where you saw your work polished. That’s what I’m talking about. Pay attention to that.</p>

    <p>The other half of readers have no idea what I’m talking about. You are the ones I want to reach out to now. </p>

    <p>If you are a programmer, and you’re designing interfaces, chances are you’re doing it wrong. What could be worse is if you don’t at least recognize this.</p>

    <p>When I first started in web development, I thought that I could be all things to everyone. I could program the backend while simultaneously making a great layout, logo, and sales-based design. I pumped out a lot of designs that I was proud of. I saw no problems with them.</p>

    <p>A full time designer colleague looked at my portfolio and said, “You really are a programmer, aren’t you?” I asked him what he meant. He explained that I really focused on lining things up in rows. What’s wrong with that, I argued. He smiled and went on, “your colors are all very monochromatic. There is no eye flow and concentration. You seem to use attention grabbing things just to fill up space.” I still was pretty incredulous. I didn’t think I had done that bad. I could use the site perfectly. He finally tamed my temper and indifference with his last sentence:</p>

    <p>“You’re not designing for your client. You’re designing for yourself.”</p>

    <p>This one experience really kicked off something for me. I suddenly had the desire to do design only when I absolutely had to. Whenever possible, I would find people who were skilled in design to offload that work to instead. I did, however, pay incredible attention to the final output. I set up some basic guidelines to follow for both myself <span>(when I had to)</span> and when I reviewed my partners’ work.</p>

    <p>First, don’t design like a programmer. Programmers think very logically. One form element goes under the next, under the next, under the next. Each step should have its own screen. Eyes go directly from left to right, one line at a time. You start and complete a process, never abandoning it in the middle. All things that programmers do and think, but all design principles that we shouldn’t employ.</p>

    <p>Designing like a programmer is not sometimes bad - it’s always bad! I think of some great tools that I use for programming that were created by a programmer, but also designed by a programmer. The core functionality does what I need it to do, but I never really feel happy about using the tool. I look at other products that were obviously developed by a team of designers and programmers, and somehow they just seem to function better. They make me feel more efficient and happier when I use them. They might even have less features, but I like them more. The difference here is that while the programmer knew what needed to be accomplished, he did not understand usage patterns of people. It was designed with logic, not with usable sense.</p>

    <p>Second, consider the anthropology of your user segment. Most products are not used by everyone of every demographic. You may wish that was our target market, but you should have a general idea of who our audience actually is. Design for them. Architect for them.</p>

    <p>It’s important to get the demographic information from the sales or marketing team as soon as you can. This is how you learn to target your product. I’m not saying demographic lock-in <span>(like forcing the font way too large for an older subset of users)</span>, but I’m saying demographic concentration. Learn who your users are, design for the most of them. Don’t design for yourself. You are one user and hopefully less than 1% of your market! That’s crazy to cater to such a small segment.</p>

    <p>Learn how your users generally use your product. You might have an idea of the demographics of your users, but what is special about them? For example, users under 20 would rather send messages via Facebook than via email. Ages 20 to 30 seem to use text messages for anything from casual conversation to important business information. Those above 30 still consider email authoritative. The point is, knowing how the users would want to use the product is just as important as learning who they actually are.</p>

    <p>Stop designing like a programmer. To have a successful product, design for your users. The end result is something that you’ll love to work on and use yourself while your users find it intuitive and valuable as well.</p>
