    <h1>#30. Great Programmers Don’t Always Know It <small>Or, how and why I almost ruined my life</small></h1>

    <p>I don’t remember anything from when I was in elementary school. I’m pretty certain classes were going on. I didn’t pay attention. For whatever reason, I could read well. When other kids were struggling reading out loud to the group, I was always the kid staring at the ceiling, and then whispering the word they were stuck on so we could continue. I read the entire book right away, and then just daydreamed and really examined that ceiling. I also built lots of little army boats out of my pencil case, pencils, and erasers.</p>

    <p>In middle school, I did basically the exact same thing. But, I also got a little bit more enterprising. And by enterprising, I mean business not like your corner store but more like the mob. Middle school was the beginning of new lockers with combinations. For some reason, a lot of my classmates could not open their new combination lockers. To me, it was super easy. They’d ask me to come and do it for them, giving me the combination for their locker. I would help them, walk away, and write down the locker position and the combination. <span>(See, our school said they changed the locker combinations each year. Instead, they just changed the numbers on the lockers. I figured out this money-saving scheme.)</span> Later on in the year, I was promoted to hall monitor during study hall. When I got really bored, I’d grab some of those locker combinations and open up some random student’s locker. This was the beginning of my weight problem, too. Perhaps it wasn’t helped by my ability to take twinkies and other cakes from the kid’s bag lunch inside their newly pilfered locker. <span>(In hindsight, I know some of the kids packed their own lunch. I wonder what they thought when they remember packing their lunch with a Hostess treat, and then at lunch it was gone.)</span> </p>

    <p>As time went on, I became an even worse kid. I started stealing CDs from lockers. Don’t worry, I was finally caught, suspended, and had to do some restitution. But not before I tried every method of getting out of trouble, including putting the stolen CDs into another kid’s locker to hide my crime.</p>

    <p>In high school, I got really bored. I started doing drugs, running away from home, and basically causing all kinds of chaos. On a field trip, I circumvented the long line from our bus at Burger King by walking across the street to go to Taco Bell. That got me suspended as well. If you met me in my sophomore year, I think you would agree that I was a bad kid going down a horrible road. </p>

    <p>But I wasn’t. I think I gave away the real problem in the descriptions of my capers. I wasn’t bad, I was bored. I had no way to channel my energy. In fact, I was probably actually really smart. Because I wasn’t challenged, I turned into a very negative version of myself.</p>

    <p>This same thing happens with some great programmers. But, it just manifests in a very different way. And there is one core reason for this.</p>

    <p>Sometimes great programmers don’t know they are great.</p>

    <p>It’s that simple. Or, they are never recognized as great. So, they act out. They may not really even know they’re “acting out.” But there are two ways that they turn bad. These are random tasks and negative reports.</p>

    <p>Sometimes really great programmers will run off and do some task that is completely devoid of any resemblance to the project they’re working on. If they are supposed to be making a website for an insurance company, they might also create the game of pacman in javascript. This clearly is not a requirement for this website! </p>

    <p>The first reaction you might have as a manager is anger. How dare they defy you? Or, even worse, how dare they steal from the company! They could be finishing this project and moving on to the next one. Instead, they wasted billable, paid time making a useless game. What a bad programmer!</p>

    <p>Rarely that’s true. Only in very unusual cases is he or she a bad programmer and a bad person. Your programmer is just better than you realize. They are not being challenged. So, they have to do something that challenges them. <span>(Because I didn’t feel challenged in high school, I regularly got high to introduce the challenge of keeping a straight face and not attracting attention to my reckless, stupid, illegal activity.)</span> The worst part of this scenario is that the programmer may not be self aware of the reasons why they did what they did. They might just say “I’m bored” if you ask them. But, that’s a clue. Don’t let it slip away.</p>

    <p>The truth is that this programmer is better than he knows and you recognize. And, because they’re better, you’re not challenging them enough. So, they’re acting out. Instead of punishing the programmer next time something like this happens, try to find out the root cause of this behavior. Find out if they were really truly being disobedient or if it was an absentminded task outside of the project scope without much thought. Chances are, they’re not bad. They are actually really, really good. Your job is to find ways to harness this, keep them on track, and challenge them.</p>

    <p>The other way that really good programmers manifest is through negative reports about everyone and everything. Initially, they might actually have an idea that they’re good at their job. However, society makes it so abundantly clear that anyone who acknowledges their own greatness is conceited. “Be modest.” “Don’t tell anyone you’re great. That would be bad.” Before you know it, the programmer has allowed everyone else to beat them down and they become negative. Look at how awesome they are, but they can’t tell anyone. Look at all the poor quality people who get promoted instead of them.</p>

    <p>In other cases, negativity might come from the programmer never realizing that they’re great. They might not understand what true level they’re at. If they’re at a high level, but everyone else is at an acceptable level in your team, this might be ok with you. But, from that programmer’s vantage point, he is at an acceptable level, and everyone else is below them, at a poor level.</p>

    <p>Bring on the negativity. </p>

    <p>You can recognize this phenomenon by listening intently to the reports the programmer gives you. Pick out any times where they brag about their own work <span>(or toot their own horn, if you will)</span>. If your programmer is suffering from public negativity from internal greatness, you’ll hear none of the self-worth statements and prideful acknowledgements. Listening intently at this step is important. The lack of self-promotion is what separates the great programmers from the truly negative, dispassionate people that you might have to cull from your team. Listen for self-aggrandizing. If there is none, continue with the troubleshooting! Otherwise, thin the herd.</p>

    <p>Next, listen for particular negative reports about fellow teammates or projects. When talking about other programmers, look for phrases that sound like “is not good enough,” “is too slow,” or “misses things a lot.” You might have to get clarification as to what specific scenarios the programmer is referring to. But, this can be another sign that the programmer doesn’t realize how good he really is. He looks at all the less talented programmers and reports them as inferior. Your job as a manager is to be able to determine the difference between a real report of useless programmers and a misguided comparison to the programmer’s own skills. If you can’t, you might actually believe that your team of good programmers is useless. If you get rid of them, you’ll have just one great programmer. He or she will burn out. Oh, and when you’re hiring replacements you might actually get the real low tier of programmers to replace your previously acceptable level.</p>

    <p>I like to think about some of the cars I had growing up and use them to illustrate my point. I had a 1978 Chevy Impala. It had a large engine but it was a tank. It took a little while to get up to highway speeds. Nothing too insane, but you could tell it was working on it. Later on, I got a 2001 Monte Carlo. This car kicked butt. I could clearly say the acceleration was much better than the Impala. Now, I have a 2009 WRX STI. It has a 0&#8211;60 of 4.7 seconds. This really kills the Monte Carlo. The Monte Carlo was slow in comparison (7.5 seconds). If someone asked me what I’d rather have, I’d like to have my STI, not that slow Monte Carlo. But, if you remember, the Monte Carlo totally kicked butt compared to the 13.6 second 0&#8211;60 time of the Impala. However, if you could only choose between the Impala or Monte Carlo, you’d pick the latter every time. It’s all about your frame of reference and comparison. Your team might be full of Monte Carlo cars. One of the cars is the STI, though. Don’t let the fact that you have a fast car make you get rid of the other ones. You never know, when that STI finally is retired, you might end up with a replacement Impala!</p>

    <p>Sometimes really good programmers just don’t realize it. Watch them and recognize that perceived disobedience or consistently negative reports are signs of this condition. If you determine that the programmer is better than you or they realize, the fix is simple. Challenge them more. Also, don’t back down from telling them what’s going on and describing what they’re doing. Confront them on the negativity. Explain that they’ve worked hard and are a great addition to the team. Teach them to understand every programmer is on their own journey. Help them attain a leadership position in the team perhaps. Or, find ways to give them the most challenging parts of the projects. Any of these steps will help you. Just don’t ignore the great programmer and think they’re just acting out.</p>
