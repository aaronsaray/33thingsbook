    <h1>#27. Motivation Isn’t Always About Money <small>That doesn’t mean shiny things aren’t distracting, though</small></h1>

    <p>When talking with a member of my team the other day about a wage adjustment I gave him, what he said surprised me. “Yeah, the raise isn’t really all that important to me.” I was taken aback. I thought everyone was driven by money! <span>(At least, that’s what you’d believe nowadays from all the special reports on television about Wall Street and corporate greed. Money, money, money!)</span> I asked more about what was important to my new favorite programmer. What motivated him? “I have things to learn and ways to grow. I get those chances here.”</p>

    <p>What a simple answer. The honesty of this answer amazed me. I know I’m doing something right if he’s willing to tell me that money isn’t important. But, I still didn’t really believe it. Not fully.</p>

    <p>Then, I began to think about others that are on this and previous teams of mine. There are some that are motivated by money. You can almost always pick these out of the crowd once you know what to look for. The money hungry are always trying to scheme a different way to get more money. They measure success by the size of the paycheck and by the quality of the car they drive to work. These are the people who ask about raises if the review has been a week late. These programmers ask about the wage during the interview. They clearly are driven and motivated by money. <span>(Somehow, I imagine them all to have really flashy shirts, jewelry and slicked back hair. Oh, and shiny shoes.)</span></p>

    <p>Others are motivated by convenience. That is, they’ve been doing the same job over and over for many months, years, or decades. They enjoy knowing what they’re going to do when they go to work. In other words, they don’t like surprises. It fulfills them to do the task put out in front of them. Want an extreme example? Check out the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. This sushi master has been doing the same tasks for decades. He loves it and he wouldn’t have it any other way. The simple task of doing his job, yet always improving, is what drives him. It motivates him. He is absurdly, insanely happy doing the same thing over and over.</p>

    <p>In the same vein of convenience, perhaps the job is close by the programmer’s house. Or it’s on the way so he can drop of his significant other on the way to work. Or any number of other conveniences and comforts you may not know about.</p>

    <p>Others enjoy the challenge. Yeah, they could make a lot of money sitting in a cubicle sporting the newest Hugo Boss suit, but they’d rather work here. The challenges presented are what drive them. They have managers and project leaders that can throw tasks at them that seem impossible. But, this programmer will find a way. They love these challenges. They love their drive home because it gives them even more time to come up with the best, most elegant solution to an otherwise unsolvable problem. <span>(Once the challenge goes away, no amount of money or promotion can keep this person. They’re moving on to the next challenge at the next company.)</span></p>

    <p>Returning to my original example, others are on your team to learn. I see this definitely in some of the younger programmers on my team. They have learned enough now that they could leave my team and perhaps join a team in a company that could pay them more money. But, they have their eyes set on the horizon and can see even more learning opportunities possible. They know their job is secure. They can find value in learning from and working with those who have many more years of experience. The learning opportunity is what drives them. Here, they are getting paid to learn.</p>

    <p>As a manager, it’s your job to pay attention to each employee and determine what their motivation is. And, news flash, their motivation most likely will not be the same as yours. You need to cater to what each individual needs. </p>

    <p>My current team of programmers is very highly motivated. For this book, I really tried to pinpoint what I do to help motivate them, and I couldn’t really come up with an exact reason. Then, a trusted peer told me I said something once that really resonated with him. He said that if I say that same phrase to my own team, no wonder they’re motivated to stay and work with me. This is what I said:</p>

    <p>“When you work for me, I will make it my number one priority - I will go above and beyond - to make sure that I make opportunities for you. If you want to learn more, I will find the budget for it. If you need time off, we’ll make it work. If you want to program a particularly tough task, I’ll assign it to you. In return, I know you’ll work hard, be honest and loyal. If there is ever a time when I can no longer make opportunities for you, I’ll be the first to tell you. And, I’ll look forward to working with you to find the next place that you can work and be successful beyond your wildest dreams.”</p>

    <p>I barely remembered saying that, but I did. And when my peer mentioned it to me as something that was particularly important to him <span>(something he implemented in his own team)</span>, I realized it was the key to my team’s motivation. Some want money. So I go to bat for them. 3% raise this year? How can I get this programmer 5%? Some want to learn. How big can I make my training budget? Some want a challenge. How do I challenge this programmer yet keep us on task to solve the business problems?</p>

    <p>I used to think that the easy answer was to throw money at the problem. You want the best programmers, throw money at them. This isn’t the case. It’s all about finding out what the true motivation of each programmer is and making sure you fit that need. <span>(As a side note, some of the best, most highest paid programmers I’ve met don’t care about the money. They simply raise their rates because of the law of cost and supply/demand. They need to be careful with their time, and high rates guarantee that.)</span></p>
