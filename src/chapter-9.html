    <h1>#9. Just Write More Code <small>Your fingers will bulk up, but in some cultures, that’s sexy</small></h1>

    <p>Really smart people should be successful. But, more often than we’d like to believe, they aren’t. They suffer from a mechanism that is meant to ensure their success, but ends up hampering them. This is analysis paralysis. <span>(Say that three times fast! But not out loud&#8230; don’t be weird.)</span></p>

    <p>I’ve met tons of people in my life that have just great amounts of potential. However, they talk themselves out of being the best person they can be. A smart friend of mine would have made a great coffee house owner, but he let his brains get the best of him. Instead of striking out and doing it, he decided not to. He became a programmer instead. That’s fine, I myself am a programmer. However, that’s not what he wanted. It’s not what he needed to do to feel successful. Instead of going full force into his idea, he analyzed it. He thought about it. He found all the negatives and got paralyzed by the thought of all the work. He never pulled the trigger. If he does finally get over this analysis paralysis, I’ll be the first one ordering his espresso! <span>(I am, after all, a programmer - gimme caffeine!!)</span></p>

    <p>This same scenario happens with really great programming engineers. They realize the value and need for planning, so they sit down and plan out the project. They incessantly document, analyze, plan, structure, architect, and compare various parts of the project. They took that planning and documenting tome from their programming classes and stretched it far beyond what is necessary. </p>

    <p>If you look around at your colleagues, you can identify this programmer. He has a great idea, but never seems to get the task done. He will miss deadlines, never complete the project, and always seem rather upset about his work. Too much time was spent planning and not enough time coding. The solution to this type of problem for programmers is very simple.</p>

    <p>Just write more code.</p>

    <p>Now am I talking about writing poor code just to have something down in the editor? YES! Am I implying that you should write a solution even if it’s not the best one? YES! Before you crucify me for being a horrible influence and despicable author, let me explain why.</p>

    <p>By just writing more code, you will actually stimulate all parts of your brain to keep thinking. You engage both left and right brains because you’re requiring both art and logic to be applied. And, don’t underestimate the brainpower you really do have. Even while you’re writing this sub-par code, you’re thinking about the problem in a different way. While you’re writing code, you’re actually solving the problem in your head in possibly a completely different way.</p>

    <p>Don’t get paralyzed by thinking of the best answer. Just come up with an answer. So, what do you do with this code when you’re done? Refactor or throw it away. Remember, it’s just bits; 1’s and 0’s. You can simply delete the file and try again. But, the exercise kept your momentum going forward. Instead of analyzing and talking yourself out of things, you tried your best idea at the time. Maybe it was wrong, but now you can look at it and know that for sure. Very few people can think entirely in abstract <span>(if we could, we’d all probably have better, more reusable code bases)</span>. If you recognize this, then you’ll have more success by thinking and acting in the linear. Pump out code, solve the problem the very first way you think of. Then, refine.</p>

    <p>Write more code. It’s going to be wrong, but that’s ok.</p>

    <p>Now, one caveat: don’t write this potentially “bad” code and move on. A common argument I hear from programmers is, “If I write bad code, the project will look done, the project manager will accept the work, and I’ll have to abandon it.” Another argument is, “I know once it’s working, I’ll not want to go back and work through it again. I want to go on to the next innovation.” While these are two seemingly different arguments, the root answer is the same. Just because code is written, doesn’t mean the problem is solved and the project is done. Write more code, and then try again and write it well. </p>

    <p>I’m not suggesting that you should do anything underhanded or dirty, but perhaps you’ll have to modify your workflow. Work in a separate sandbox and only contribute the pieces that are up to the standards that you want. Have a little self control and pride in your work when thinking of moving on to innovation. Remember, someone else will see this. Just because you innovate, doesn’t mean you’re great. <span>(As for innovators, I think about all those blog writers who write “introduction to blahblah technology” articles. They’re on the forefront finding out all the newest stuff and teaching people the very basics. However, they’re rarely as respected as those who apply a significant amount of time and energy towards mastery of a technology.)</span></p>

    <p>Write more code, write early, write often, and refine. </p>

    <p>This advice is especially useful for beginner and novice programmers. Face it, you just won’t have enough experience to come up with the most elegant and accurate solutions. Time breeds design maturity. So, while you’re less experienced, just write more code. Look over it and see if it’s good enough. If not, refactor and refine. You may find yourself spending a little time planning, a medium amount of time writing, and a lot of time refactoring. This is fine. This is what you need to do at this point in your career.</p>

    <p>Those very experienced programmers may follow this rule, to some extent. However, they have the skill and experience to spend most of their time planning. Then, they can execute and create the most elegant, accurate code and programming solutions. Very little time is spent refactoring. This level of mastery and the ability to do it right the first time is because they have done this before. They have written a lot of code.</p>

    <p>The paths of writing more and planning more are even slopes. As you progress through your career and gain experience, you’ll notice that these slopes intersect. Your path goes from one to the next. Finally, you’re starting to plan more, and write just the right amount of code.</p>

    <p>I can’t think of a time that I’ve ever heard of anyone saying, “Wow, I wish I wouldn’t have written so much code in my life.” There are really no negatives about writing a lot of code. And, since we’re in an electronic media, its pretty easy to manage. So, write more code. Engage the brain in many ways of solving the problem. Refactor as needed. Please, just write more code.</p>
