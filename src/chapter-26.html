    <h1>#26. If You are Seducing a Developer, Follow-Through Is Key <small>Sometimes it takes more than one date to know if this is “the one”</small></h1>

    <p>I’ve had my share of struggles finding developers to fill positions on my team. But, every one I have is the exact one I needed. I took the time to put out a job opening, follow up, do research and seduce a great programmer. I don’t take the attitude that they should be lucky that they’re getting a job. I realize this is a two way street. I need something from them, so I seduce them. I rambled about this on my blog after I had a particularly silly conversation with a recruiter once.</p>

    <p>I remember a scene from “A Night at the Roxbury” where the less-than-slick brothers take some girls back to their room and have a problem closing the deal. One of them keeps saying pickup lines while he has the girl sitting on his bed. She basically says ok, we’re past this. He just can’t seem to close the deal no matter how much she wants him to.</p>

    <p>That reminds me of what happens sometimes when I watch recruiters and other business people when it comes to seducing developers to projects. They pitch a great idea, get a little bit of interest, and then stop there. They don’t close the deal. They offer things but never follow through.</p>

    <p>I’ve been hearing for the longest time that it’s very hard to recruit for PHP developers in our area. I’ve seen offers from recruiters for these jobs to those who aren’t looking. Even if they pique a little interest, the recruiters never follow through. Let me give a fun example.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Recruiter emails: here’s a great job for you if you’re looking.</p>
        <p>Developer: No Thanks.</p>
        <p>{{ crickets }}</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Hey – that’s not follow through! Why did the developer say no? Because he’s not looking? Or is it because the job doesn’t suit him? Recruiter, you lost out on gathering some more information and possibly getting this programmer as a hire. Here’s another example.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Business owner: I’d love to buy you lunch or a drink and just talk – see if you can give me some advice about some upcoming projects.</p>
        <p>Developer: Cool, let me know.</p>
        <p>{{ same damn crickets }}</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In both scenarios, the initiator probably wants the developer for their team. But, there is no follow through. However, there is hope!</p>

    <p>Recently I’ve been noticing the recruiters follow through a little with a response saying “Thanks.” Not huge, but it’s making progress. But, you need more follow up than this. </p>

    <p>Dear business owner, manager or recruiter, let me tell you a truth that no programmer wants to admit. Computer “people” are not the same as you. Every group of people have their own traits and some generalities seem to hold true for them. In the programmer world, these can be at odds with bubbly owners and recruiters. <span>(Ok fine, some of us can’t stop talking and want to be your best friend, like a little puppy. But, that’s not the norm.)</span> Now, I don’t want to offend with generalities, I’m only working from my own experience. But, I’ve noticed a higher percentage of nervousness, a greater fear of the unknown, and a high propensity to do anything to avoid situations with failure and social risk in programmers.</p>

    <p>So here’s my advice: Follow through. Let’s do the scenarios again.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Recruiter emails: here’s a great job for you if you’re looking.</p>
        <p>Developer: No Thanks.</p>
        <p>Recruiter: Alright! Thanks so much for taking the time to get back to me. Really appreciate it. I know not every opportunity is a great fit at this time, but do keep me in mind if you’re looking for any new challenges. I’ve got a few positions that offer unique sets of rewards for the right individual.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Oh, and dear recruiter, if you’re local, build some bonus points. Continue with this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Recruiter: Actually, if you’re a coffee addict like me, could I buy you some coffee at Starbucks next week? I could use some insight from people like you to find out how I might find other qualified candidates. </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Programmers are people too. And, people like feeling important and wanted. The fact that you’re following through really displays this. Plus, through this time you invest, you get to know the person, and determine why they may have turned down your original offer. Maybe they really are looking, but the job wasn’t a fit. Now you have a chance to develop a profile on this candidate to help them out in the future.
        Let’s look at the other example.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Business owner: I’d love to buy you lunch or a drink and just talk – see if you can give me some advice about some upcoming projects.</p>
        <p>Developer: Cool, let me know.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let’s take a quick pause and try to predict what each is thinking. My guess is that the business owner is thinking, “well I’m pretty busy so when the developer has some time, he’ll email me.” The developer is thinking, “That seems cool, and I know business owners are busy, but why isn’t he getting back to me?”</p>

    <p>Here’s how the follow up should go:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Business owner: Excellent! Next thursday looks pretty open for me. Would you like to go to the local Chinese restaurant at noon? If there is a better time, let me know!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These little bits make a difference. No matter if you’re a recruiter, owner, or a manager, you’ll need someone at some point. If you’re trying to seduce someone to a job, follow through. People sometimes need that extra little push.</p>
