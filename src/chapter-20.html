    <h1>#20. Step Up to Be A Senior Programmer <small>Show these youngins that programming only went downhill after punch cards</small></h1>

    <p>Perhaps I’m the only person who pictures a balding, old man with a white beard when I hear Senior Programmer. I even picture him getting a discount at his local diner. Maybe I’m just weird. But, then, what is a senior programmer?</p>

    <p>The senior programmer on a team is a very valuable position. This status could be reflected with a higher wage, a nicer office or better access to resources <span>(and that’s great!)</span> It might also be shown by the boss seeming to favor this position above all others. Who gets the nicest computer? Senior programmer. Who is the one who gets to meet the CEO? Senior programmer.</p>

    <p>But, dear Senior Programmer, how do you follow up on your part of the deal? What are the requirements for this title, the things that you must do to cement this valuable position?</p>

    <p>I recently promoted a programmer to the status of Senior Programmer. During our meeting, we were talking about his concerns about this new set of responsibilities. He gave the normal concerns but the one that really stuck out to me was his last statement.</p>

    <p>“Well, this isn’t going to be easy.”</p>

    <p>No kidding! No one promised it would be easy. The promotion wasn’t meant to be a gift. It wasn’t meant to make your job easier. It was meant to plug a hole in my team. I needed that Senior Programmer. So, I’ll ask again, how does the Senior Programmer provide value? What hole is he there to plug?</p>

    <p>The Senior Programmer is no longer a task-only programmer. A normal programmer is put on a project or a task, and that’s what they complete. They will analyze all of the requirements for this task, provide the best estimate, and create the best solution possible. A senior programmer does this, and then some. He looks beyond the here and now. He thinks before this task, during the task, and after the task about all the ramifications of this new software or project. How will this task affect other features? What can we do to make sure this has the most impact and reward? What are the things we have to consider after this project is complete? The Senior Programmer is the master and keeper of these thoughts.</p>

    <p>Since the Senior Programmer is no longer a task programmer, they must push themselves to serve as the valuable linchpin in the team. Some teams organize themselves in a way where a certain set of programmers are the authority when it comes to a certain project. Each team member has some code or application that they are the go-to resource for. Other teams are organized in a round-robin sort of project management. Each time a new feature comes up for a product, a different programmer is assigned. The rotation continues on each product, project and feature. However, if you pay close attention, you’ll still notice that each project or feature tends to have a lead programmer or champion. Generally, this is the programmer who initially created the feature. This is the person that the other team members lean on when they can’t immediately fix the problem.</p>

    <p>Senior programmer, you are no longer allowed to do this. You must now know the intimate details of all of your projects. If you don’t know something, take the time to learn it. This position may require a bit more work initially and some research on your point. Suck it up and do it. This is your task and your responsibility.</p>

    <p>Consequently, you need to demonstrate this value by making sure that all on your team know that you’re available to help them. Regular and junior programmers should be looking to you, no matter what project, to help them. If you don’t know, you’ll find out for them. This way, you’ll learn it and be able to help them out too. Chances are, because of your already large knowledge base and ability to troubleshoot, you’ll be able to ask other programmers who know the answer and get to the solution faster anyway! The senior programmer is this connection to the team.</p>

    <p>The Senior Programmer position is actually a lot more about giving than you may realize. I’ve met programmers that imagine the senior position as something that allows them to get a private office, close the door, and just nerd out all day long on complex algorithms. Not true. The senior programmer is now the glue of the team. They not only code, they serve the other team members by collectively taking the lead in solving problems.</p>

    <p>Another way the Senior Programmer serves is through the connection they have with the boss or manager. Managers, no matter how good-intentioned, normally don’t have enough time to develop an intimate relationship with each programmer on the team. They should focus on their senior programmers, though. Your job as the senior programmer is to listen to your team, and then leverage your position with the boss. Learn to distill the team needs into something that the boss can easily hear and understand. Give of your time to go to bat for your team. The Senior Programmer is someone that can solve all of these problems for the team.</p>

    <p>There is a difference between a manager and a leader. Great managers are also leaders. But, even if you have a great manager, leadership flows down. It manifests on many levels. Whereas all the programmers have a boss <span>(the manager)</span>, the Senior Programmer generally tends to act as the most connected, main “leader” on the ground and in the trenches with the team. All of this giving and service is a reflection of a great leader. The senior programmer becomes the glue that holds the whole team together while simultaneously leading them through the journey.</p>

    <p>From the other side, the manager depends on the Senior Programmer for a lot of this connections. A manager might also lean on the Senior Programmer as the one that comes to meetings as an analyst. Instead of having to pick what programmer would be best for each meeting and project, the boss can just lean back and schedule the Senior Programmer.</p>

    <p>As you see, there are different requirements and responsibilities with being a Senior Programmer. It’s not all about just being recognized as a better coder. It’s also about developing a team, leadership, and being a connection for all those around you. The Senior Programmer label is almost akin to a Team Leader label. </p>

    <p>For those who are great programmers and want to continue to program, perhaps the Senior Programmer position isn’t something that you should aim for. Just like when you’re a programmer and a management position opens up, you might not always want to go for it. But, if you find value in programming and see how a greater connection and more leadership in your team could propel the team farther forward, then this position is for you.</p>
