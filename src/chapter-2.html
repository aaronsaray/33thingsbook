    <h1>#2. Log Everything <small>Lies, damn lies, and logging</small></h1>

    <p>People lie. I lie. Even you lie. So, what can you do about it?</p>

    <p>Log everything. It’s very simple. If something happens, log it. </p>

    <p>Chapter done. </p>

    <p>Users will lie to you. And the worst part is, they don’t even mean to. When I used to do technical support for a local Internet Service Provider, I ran into some of the worst liars. Now, mind you, these were good, quality, hard working people, but they were liars. They didn’t mean to be, but they were.</p>

    <p>I can think of one particular example that makes me laugh still. I was working with an older lady and she was having problems getting connected to the Internet. I asked her what version of Windows she had. She said Windows ME. I started giving her tips to get to the control panel and look at her TCP/IP settings. Each time I gave her a new step to complete, she sounded somewhat confused. She sometimes would repeat different words than I had said. For example, when I said “Network and Internet Settings” she would say “Ok, opened Internet Options.” Towards the end of this troubleshooting step, I was telling her to check on a specific Windows ME setting. She swore up and down that she couldn’t see the option I was referring to. I asked her again what version of Windows she had. She rather angrily confirmed that she had Windows ME. I couldn’t seem to solve her problem because the remaining step just couldn’t get accomplished if she couldn’t find the option I needed.</p>

    <p>She finally became so angry that she put her daughter on the phone. I asked the daughter what she saw on the screen. She described the placement of all the icons and the labels. I asked what version of Windows it was and she said it was Windows 98. I said her mother had insisted it was Windows ME and that’s why we were having problems solving the internet connection issue. She laughed and told me that her mom had just saw the newest computer commercial on TV earlier that day. Because she couldn’t get on the Internet, she was thinking of buying a new computer. This new computer came with Windows ME installed. So, because her mom didn’t know much about the different versions of Windows, she had just assumed from that point forward that she also had Windows ME on her older computer. </p>

    <p>In this story, the mother lied to me. She didn’t mean to and she didn’t even know she did, but it really was a lie. <span>(Some would argue that a lie is purposeful, and this was just a mistake, but I disagree. In this case, this became more than a mistake and morphed into a lie because she insisted on a false truth without taking the steps to verify it.)</span></p>

    <p>When I create software, I’m very generous with my logging. I like to log everything. I log errors, debug messages, and even changes to records, objects, and data. I try to build historical paths so that I can audit the changes that the system has gone through. <span>(Now that data storage is much cheaper, how can you justify not storing this information?)</span> This helps immensely with tracking down what users do before, during, and after a problem occurs.</p>

    <p>I’ve had a number of instances when support requests were put in and my logging helped track down the problem. I can think of another scenario where a customer service representative at one of the companies I worked at was lying to the programmers. There was a multi-step process that needed to occur in one particular order for both business and technical reasons. Other representatives were able to do the task accurately. Nothing bad happened with their customer records. However, when this particular individual did the task, she always had to submit a support request because “the software is way too buggy.” We asked repeatedly if she did the process the right way. She swore she did. </p>

    <p>Looking back into the log files, we were able to determine when she had logged into the website and what data she had changed. We were able to recreate her tasks on our test system. Then, we were able to correlate those steps with timestamps on other systems and found out why she was having the issue. She was repeatedly doing the tasks in a different order than what was required and lying about it. Once I presented this information, I closed the support issue as not relevant. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt - she didn’t realize she was lying. <span>(Turns out, a week later when I was doing follow up on the support request, I found out she was no longer working for the company. Hmmmm.)</span></p>

    <p>When we look at ourselves, we can’t imagine we’d lie <span>(or make mistakes and let them spiral out of control into “lies”)</span>. Yeah, normal users do that, but certainly not us. Software programmers are far more honest and accurate. I know that I would never lie.</p>

    <p>Except, I did. I lied to my car mechanic. He was very gracious in how he caught me, making sure I knew of my mistake while not embarrassing me too much <span>(in public)</span>. </p>

    <p>I was having brake problems. Whenever I slowed down, I heard a horrible grinding sound. It felt like the wheel might even fall off. I brought my car into the mechanic and did my best to describe the problem. He asked if it was all the time or just when I hit the brake hard. I said all the time, no matter what. He questioned if it was when I turned left, right, or all the time. I said it was all the time. He took the car and went to work. <span>(Maybe he knew right then I was lying. The loaner car that he gave me was&#8230; interesting at best. Purple is not my color.)</span></p>

    <p>Later, my mechanic called me with the bill and an explanation. He said it looked like I had problems with my right-front brakes and suspension. He said these would have been apparent with hard braking and when I turned to the right. He said when his team tested it, they found that right away. After thinking about it, I put it all together. I had lied! I was so angry about having car problems that the specifics had clouded in my head. The more I thought about it, I realized what had happened. Normally, I heard the problem when I was heading home from work. I had a stressful job at that time so I was particularly aggressive when driving home. Plus, my road was a right turn off of a very busy main road. I drove the road too fast, had to turn right into my subdivision and would usually brake very hard. If I would have told him this, he could have easily told me what the problem was. Instead, I had <span>(accidentally)</span> lied to him. I guess I’m not immune to this either.</p>

    <p>Log everything. When in doubt, create a log of the problem. When something doesn’t match the workflow, log it. In fact, start creating software with logging first. If you really need to conserve disk space or have a heavy load where extra logging deeply affects performance, initiate multiple levels of logging, so you can adjust what amount of logging you need based on the situation. Another thing that I’ve implemented in some of my projects is various levels of logging targeted per user or per platform. This allows me to turn on extensive logging for only one user in the system. All in all, you’ll never find that you regret having created more logs than less. It not only helps cover yourself against false bugs, but it helps you track down existing ones faster, too!</p>
