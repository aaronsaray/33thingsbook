    <h1>#13. Sometimes, Just Be Great <small>Or, succumb to the manager motto: “Mo’ money, mo’ problems.”</small></h1>

    <p>A few days ago, I was interviewing web designers for a new position I need to fill. I try not to ask the cheesy, “Where do you see yourself in 5 years” type question. I do want to know the answer to this, though. So I’ve come up with a different way to ask it.</p>

    <p>The particular candidate we were interviewing was a very junior designer. He had many years to go before he would be someone I would consider to be in the position of Senior Web Designer. And many, many more before I thought he was experienced enough to run his own team. So, I asked him the newly phrased question: “What is it that you really want to be the path of your career?” </p>

    <p>He answered in what might have been a textbook answer. “I want to put my time in to become a great designer. In a few years, I’d love to manage a team of designers.” This, however, is not the answer I was looking for. It wasn’t because I thought he would be some competition for my job, but because I didn’t believe him. I wasn’t sure if he wanted to be a manager at some time. Perhaps he just thought that was the best answer or the right answer for an interview. I asked him that point blank: “Do you really want to be a manager in a few years, or are you saying you’d like to contribute to the project in a meaningful way?” He went on to explain what he thought he would like to accomplish in his career. Long story short, he just wanted to just be highly skilled, important and respected. He didn’t particularly have any desire to be a manager.</p>

    <p>I’m glad I was able to determine what this candidate really wanted out of his career. I sometimes fear that the standard career advice forces people to think that they must be managers or business owners. Not everyone is cut out for that. Sometimes, it’s just ok to be great.</p>

    <p>Let me explain further - if you’re a follower of my blog, you might recognize this. </p>

    <p>What is the measurement of a good career? Promotion? Raises? Running a project / leading a team? Usually all of this. However, the most traditional measurement of success in a career is moving upward. Time to run a department, time to lead a team, etc. However, I submit a very radical idea: sometimes just be great, don’t lead.</p>

    <p>What does this mean? Well so often, we see great engineers get promoted to be our ‘boss.’ However, when this happens, suddenly the department starts to slip, success is lost, and this engineer isn’t as happy as he used to be. Sometimes it’s ok to just be great at your job. Know that being the number one resource, the go-to for your skill, is good enough. If your goal is seniority, demand it for your position. If your desire is more money, demand it. Sometimes we think that getting to a leadership position is the only way to gain. I would suggest to really look at this before you try to achieve it.</p>

    <p>When you become a leader or a ‘manager,’ your responsibilities will change. Remember that exciting feeling when you solved a problem? You programmed a solution and it worked the first time!? This is something you won’t experience as often as a leader. Instead, your goals will be bottom line, juggling numbers, and dealing with people. How do you keep your department inspired and on track?</p>

    <p>Let me break it down very frankly. There are two things to consider. First, if you want more money, ask for it. Keep doing what you’re so good at, demonstrate and document your value, and ask for it. Don’t take a promotion if that’s truly not what you want. A promotion generally means not necessarily more responsibility but different responsibility. Do you want this? Be honest with yourself. If you really don’t <span>(maybe you don’t like being in front of people, you like taking responsibility for yourself only instead of a team you had little hand in with the end result, etc)</span>, don’t do it. There are other opportunities and different jobs. There is always a different company that has the same needs as you’re filling right now, but they’re bigger and more scaled. That will translate into more money.</p>

    <p>Second, are you willing to give up the thrill of the chase of programming and trade that in for the successful balancing of numbers and managing of people? Be honest with yourself. When you enter a room, do people congregate to you – or do you wait to be introduced? A manager(leader) needs to have these people skills. In addition, you need to be able to take responsibility for all the negatives for your team, but disseminate all the accolades. Can you do this? If not, just continue to be great, don’t lead.</p>

    <p>So, again my idea: sometimes just be great – don’t strive to lead. You may find that you cause more harm than good, and you become unhappy. Instead, take pride in being the best you can be at that skill you’ve already mastered. Just be great.</p>

    <p>The point here is to remind great programmers that they can be just that: great. You’re not less of a programmer, you’re not less of a success, just because you don’t want to be a manager. Those who run a truly successful company - the kind that you should be working at anyway - will value your honesty and skills. They’ll love that “you just want to be great.”</p>

    <p>As a manager now, I can absolutely attest that this is the truth. I always encourage my team members to become better, more efficient and learn more skills. If they truly want to learn more about management or product development, I am the first to support them. But, I do not want to push them into leadership positions if they don’t want it. A good manager shows great programmers that he appreciates the programmer just the way they are. </p>

    <p>Oh, and here’s a secret too: bad managers want to keep employees who have aspirations on their own team and to themselves for selfish reasons. Good managers want to keep star employees because they make the manager’s job easier but they won’t stop creating opportunities for them even if it means losing them in the long run. It’s fine to be good. It’s ok if you want to be a manager after you’ve reached your goals in programming. It’s great just to be great.</p>
