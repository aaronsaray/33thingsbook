    <h1>#21. Write Out Your Goals <small>Goal #1, finish this book. Goal #2, profit!</small></h1>

    <p>In almost every leadership class I’ve ever taken and every book that I’ve scanned through <span>(because come-on, after a while they all seem to rehash the same things, right?)</span>, I’ve always seen one particular piece of advice that I’ve never really taken to heart. </p>

    <p>Physically write down your goals.</p>

    <p>Hogwash. Why do I need to write these down? Afterwards, the experts tell you to frequently go back and look at your goals. Some suggest putting your goals on a notepad that is always within your sight. <span>(How embarrassing - have a colleague in your office and they now see your life plan on your bulletin board.)</span> I thought this advice was probably one of the most stupid things I’ve ever heard. Plus, as a programmer, I don’t write things anyway. I keep all the important stuff in my head - or I search Google.</p>

    <p>One day I woke up with a great idea for a new project. I could see the screens in my head. I knew exactly what I wanted to accomplish. But wait&#8230; what did the screen look like again? I freaked out because everything was already fading from my mind. So, I grabbed my moleskin notebook and sat down and sketched out the images in my head. Then, I made a bullet point list of the project’s goals. Finally, before I began the project that day, I put together another list of the tools and libraries I’d need to implement, what domain name to register, and what email service to get activated. <span>(I hate when stories just end like this with no follow up on the cool idea. I was going to do that to you, too, because the end isn’t that exciting. But, here you go: I implemented the project. It wasn’t as amazing as I thought. I ended up closing it down. But, I was able to sell the domain name afterward for $1,000, so I guess that’s kind of a success.)</span></p>

    <p>This experience made me really think about the advice pounded into my head about physically writing down goals. Here I had this great idea when I woke up and then it started to fade. The idea was fresh and I wanted to implement it, but I was slowly losing my vision of it. So, I took pen to paper and sketched out my ideas. I created my bullet point list of tasks so I wouldn’t miss any.</p>

    <p>You wouldn’t start out a programming project without at least making a list of your tasks and goals, right? If you’re a newer programmer, you just guffawed at this silly statement. Just let me code! But those who have more experience absent-mindedly agreed to this statement in that ‘duh’ way. Of course I’d write down a few tasks; there’s no other way to begin.</p>

    <p>So, in our profession, we create lists. We plan things out because we know we may forget things. Even in the moment, when this project is the most important thing in the world, we forget things. <span>(That’s one of the reasons why programmers create bugs! I bet there is not a single programmers out there thinking “yeah I’d like to have some bugs.” Everyone hates bugs. And one of the reasons we have them is we forget things during the programming process.)</span> To combat this forgetfulness, we write down tasks. Or, if you’re completely crazy like me, you not only write stuff down in a nice, orderly notebook, but you have a thousand little sticky notes on your desk too <span>(including amazing scribbles that made sense when you drew them)</span>. Oh Sticky notes! Because sometimes, paging through your bookmarked moleskin page takes just a tad too long compared to the immediately available yellow pad you can scribble on and then stick to your desk top. <span>(Note to self: need to clean off some of this 5 year old 3M glue residue.)</span></p>

    <p>If this is all true, why is it so weird that I’d write my life goals out in the same way?</p>

    <p>I decided to do this. I broke the list out into a few topics: professional goals, family goals, retirement goals, health and spirituality goals, and finally charity goals.</p>

    <p>I took some time one day to write out all my goals. I looked long term. </p>

    <p>This was a tough day. </p>

    <p>I had such a hard time writing down what I wanted. I really didn’t have any idea what I wanted in my life. Somehow I had convinced myself I was on the right path, but what path was it?</p>

    <p>It was a really hard day.</p>

    <p>I cried about 5 times throughout the day. I realized how far away I was away from some goals. Other times, just coming face to face with the deepest needs in my life caused me to lose control.</p>

    <p>It was one of the hardest days I can remember.</p>

    <p>It was the most valuable day I’ve ever spent.</p>

    <p>At the end of the day, I had my list of goals. I followed all of the rules from all the books when it came to writing them down and organizing my thoughts. I wrote them in first person as present conditions. I didn’t say “I want,” instead I said “I have.” I put these all in a document in Google Docs. </p>

    <p>Some of these goals are private. I will accomplish them, but I don’t feel like telling the world about them. I don’t mind sharing a few of my goals publicly, though.</p>

    <p>Some of my publicly available goals:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I have started, organized, and made self-sustaining 5 community or non-profit groups.</p>

        <p>I bike, kayak, or walk a few miles at least twice a week. I’ve not missed one week.</p>

        <p>I have found a faith-based community where I participate and actively learn and grow.</p>

        <p>I own a company that supports 50 families through employment opportunities.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>As you can see, some of these goals are pretty simple. Others are lofty. Either way, they’re my goals. I wrote them down.</p>

    <p>The next step was setting a reminder to check them every month. At the beginning of each month, I make sure I read through each one of my goals. </p>

    <p>But, for those who are afraid of being pigeonholed, here’s one bit of good news. Every month, I review each goal for two things. First, how far along am I? <span>(I’ve created one community group that is self-sustaining. I’m working on my second one as I write this.)</span> And, second, do they still make sense? </p>

    <p>It’s not wrong to change your goals in your list. Remember, this is a guide to being successful, it’s not the rules. So, if it’s not reflecting where your life is going, don’t give up and throw out all your goals. Just change them.</p>

    <p>That’s not a free pass to remove goals that are tough. But, be honest with yourself. If your goal was to live on the coast of California by the time you’re 30, but you’ve married and you can’t imagine a place better than being surrounded by your family and your spouse’s family in northern Minnesota, change the goal. Find a way to get down to the core of your desire about moving to California was, and change the goal to reflect that. Perhaps you wanted to be involved with fresh food or technology that is rampant in California. Well, Minnesota has that too. So, change your goal from moving to California to becoming involved with your local technology and community sponsored agriculture movement.</p>

    <p>Now that I have this list, I’m surprised how many things I’ve already completed. I’ve actually accomplished a lot! It’s a great way to track your progress.</p>

    <p>It also helps me make decisions. When faced with a tough decision, I look at my goals list again. I make the decision that takes me closest to one of my goals. Then, while I don’t know if my short-term decision was right, I know I at least made the right decision for my longer term path.</p>

    <p>Ok, this sounds all fine and dandy, but how does this relate to programming?</p>

    <p>If you want to be a great programmer, understand that programming is your career. A good career is just like life. You can have a plan for it. You can have a goal sheet for it. You are the master of your life, why are you not the master of your career?</p>

    <p>If you develop your goal sheet for your career, it will help you make better decisions at your job. Perhaps your goal is to be a development manager. Then, you know what types of positions you should apply for and what size companies to work for. Perhaps you have a goal of learning 5 programming languages in 5 years. You know you might have to do self-study to accomplish this. Or, if your company is working you too hard and will only stay with one technology, ever, perhaps its time to look for a new position.</p>

    <p>Surfing technology blogs and getting certifications is a great thing to do. It sure uses up your time and makes you feel like you’re getting somewhere. This is the same thing as building a widget by hand. But, those who are really successful develop an automated assembly line to develop that widget. Stop making widgets by aimlessly ‘getting better’ with technology, and build your career into an assembly line of efficiency by writing out your goals. </p>
