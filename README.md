# 33 Things I Wish Somebody Would Have Told Me 

This is the source for the [33 Things Book Website](http://33thingsbook.com).

I recommend you go there and read it!

For the **tl;dr** of you: Over my career I learned a lot of hard lessons as a programmer.  I wanted to share these with you so you don't make the same mistake.  Read this damn book and save yourself tons of problems in the future, ok?
